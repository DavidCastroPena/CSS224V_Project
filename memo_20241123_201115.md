*   **Does Head Start Improve Children’s Life Chances?**: This study shows a significant positive impact of Head Start on child mortality rates, particularly for causes directly or indirectly addressed by the program's health services.

**Papers focusing on data and methodology:**

*   **Revising Infant Mortality Rates**: This paper highlights the significant upward bias in infant mortality rates due to underregistration of births, emphasizing the need for data correction in policy analysis.
*   **Water Treatment and Child Mortality**: This meta-analysis demonstrates the significant impact of water treatment on reducing child mortality in low- and middle-income countries, highlighting its cost-effectiveness.


## Recommendations

Based on the reviewed research, the following recommendations are proposed to reduce child mortality in Mississippi County through nutrition-focused policies:

1.  **Implement a comprehensive nutrition education program:**  Target low-income households with evidence-based curricula addressing knowledge gaps and behavioral risk factors associated with prematurity, low birth weight, and Sudden Unexpected Infant Death (SUID).  This program should be modeled after the successful intervention highlighted in the Mississippi-based study.

2.  **Enhance access to nutritious foods:** Advocate for increased federal reimbursement rates for school meals and explore strategies to improve access to fresh, healthy foods in underserved communities.  This aligns with the recommendations of "A New Health Care Prevention Agenda" and addresses the broader context of food security and its impact on child health.

3.  **Strengthen parenting support programs:** Implement or expand parenting programs that emphasize responsive caregiving, mirroring the successful interventions highlighted in the study on improving outcomes for young children.  These programs should be culturally sensitive and accessible to all families.

4.  **Improve data collection and analysis:**  Ensure accurate and complete birth registration to avoid biases in infant mortality rate estimates, as highlighted in the study revising infant mortality rates.  This will allow for more accurate monitoring and evaluation of interventions.

5.  **Address water quality:**  Assess the quality of drinking water in the county and implement water treatment strategies where necessary, considering the cost-effectiveness demonstrated in the meta-analysis on water treatment and child mortality.

6.  **Consider long-term interventions:**  Explore the potential for long-term, intergenerational benefits of nutrition interventions, as demonstrated by the study on deworming.  This may involve focusing on the health and well-being of parents as well as children.


These recommendations provide a multi-faceted approach to reducing child mortality in Mississippi County by focusing on nutrition, education, and access to essential resources.  Regular monitoring and evaluation are crucial to ensure the effectiveness of these policies and to make necessary adjustments based on the data.
