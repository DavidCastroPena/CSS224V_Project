CMN Resolution 3,110 of July 31, 2003.\n12Figure 2: Public vs. Private Bank Covariate Balance\nLoans\nDeposits\nPro\ufb01ts\nROA\nNon-Performing Loans\nLoss Provisions\nTotal Assets\nLiquid Assets\nTotal Liabilities\n-.15 -.1 -.05 0 .05 .1 .15\nThis figure shows coefficient estimates and 95% error bands of the difference between public and private banks along different\nvariables, using ESTBAN data at the branch-year level between 2000 and 2004. All variables are normalized to have a mean of\nzero and a standard deviation of one. Standard errors are clustered at the bank level.\nTaken together, these findings suggest that banking correspondents were present in many\nunbanked municipalities prior to the reform but mostly provided bill payment services. While\nhaving some access to financial services is certainly better than no access at all, the fact that\nthese services were limited implies that the expansion of branch networks we study led to\nfinancial inclusion by improving the quality and scope of financial products and services to\nwhich households and businesses have access.\n2.2 Data\nWe use data from four distinct sources. Matched employer-employee data come from the\nRela\u00b8 c\u02dc ao Anual de Informa\u00b8 c\u02dc oes (RAIS), a mandatory annual survey containing information\non the universe of tax-registered firms in Brazil. There are severe penalties associated with\nincomplete or late information, which leads to a high degree of compliance and essentially\ncomplete coverage of all employees in the formal sector. RAIS contains time-invariant identi-\nfiers for workers and firms, as well as information on where the firm is located. We also observe\ndata on workers average gross monthly earnings, occupation and several socio-demographic\ncharacteristics such as their education, race, age, and gender.\n13Using geographical information on firms, we build a city-level panel from 2000 to 2014\nwith information on average wages, wage inequality, employment, and skill-specific wages.\nBecause municipality borders have changed over time, we",
