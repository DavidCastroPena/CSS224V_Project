Bank branch\nproximity mitigates the transaction costs of mobilizing savings from many agents, which\ncan increase the capital available to entrepreneurs. Branch proximity also lowers the cost to\nbanks of screening and monitoring entrepreneurs, and of providing access to liquidity services.\nHowever, setting up bank branches is not only costly but also risky, as demand for deposits\nand loans can only be observed after the creation of the branch, which can lead to an under-\nprovision of financial services.\nFor this reason, policymakers across the world have sought to promote financial inclu-\nsion by implementing large-scale reforms to expand the physical networks of bank branches.1\nThe popularity of these financial inclusion policies raises multiple questions: do they suc-", "article_title": "FinancialInclusionEvidenceBrazil", "full_section_title": "", "block_type": "text", "language": "en", "last_edit_date": "2024-01-01", "num_tokens": 292}

First, if public banks experience idiosyncratic shocks that affect their\ncredit supply after 2004 (either due to shocks to their cost of funding or because they face\npolitical pressure to extend credit), both treated and control cities will benefit from a credit\nexpansion, and our coefficient of interest will not be biased.22\nSecond, potential correlations between financial inclusion policies and the expansion of\nother social welfare programs after 2004 are also addressed due to a specificity of the Brazil-\nian institutional context.

The second main concern is that ex-ante\ndifferences lead treated cities to respond differentially to aggregate shocks.\nWe address this problem in four ways.

Financial frictions can directly impact labor demand if there is a mis-\nmatch between payments to labor and the generation of cash-flows or if labor has a fixed-cost\ncomponent due to hiring and firing costs (Schoefer, 2021; Benmelech, Bergman, and Seru,\n2021).

These effects materialize over time, underlying the need to study a\nlong-enough period to capture the true effect of one-time reforms on long-run development.\nThis important economic development triggered a substantial rise in wage inequality, which\nis mostly explained by the limited supply of skilled labor in some cities. This result raises the\nquestion of whether governments should also implement simultaneous labor-oriented policies\nin order to reap the full benefit of formal financial market policies.\n43. A notable exception is Cagetti and De Nardi (2006) who allows individuals to have different productivity\nas workers and entrepreneurs, but focus on wealth inequality.\n44. The fact that a large part of the Gini index of total income is explained by wages in the aggregate is not\nthat surprising since, in Brazil, over 72% of the population are employees and not entrepreneurs. This high\nfraction confirms that understanding the drivers of wage inequality among employees is an important avenue\nfor better understanding how financing frictions affect aggregate inequality.\n48The importance of financial inclusion also has potential implications for current and future", "article_title": "FinancialInclusionEvidenceBrazil", "full_section_title": "", "block_type": "text", "language": "en", "last_edit_date": "2024-01-01", "num_tokens": 275}

Such policies are already underway in some developing countries\nwith the goal of expanding financial access, including in Brazil with the launch of an instant\npayment platform (Pix) and its mandatory use by all financial institutions and payment\ninstitutions that are licensed by the Central Bank of Brazil. This initiative, by improving\ndeposit provisions and lowering costs of access to liquidity services, should boost development\nand firm growth, particularly in tradable industries. However, whether this initiative alone\nwill achieve its intended goals or if, instead, it would be complementary with the expansion of\nphysical bank branches remains an open debate. It might well be the case that the expected\ngains from Pix will materialize mostly in places where households and businesses are already\nbanked if the initial connection to the formal finance sector requires the physical presence of\na bank branch.\nOur results also imply that policies such as digital banking that increase financial inclusion\nfor retail customers and for small and medium-sized enterprises could be a source of substantial\nincrease in inequality in the future if they interact with other frictions, such as the limited\nsupply of human capital, that are prevalent in many developing countries.\nReferences\nAbowd, John, Francis Kramarz, and David Margolis. 1999. \u201cHigh Wage Workers and High Wage Firms.\u201d Econometrica 67 (2):\n251\u2013333.", "article_title": "FinancialInclusionEvidenceBrazil", "full_section_title": "", "block_type": "text", "language": "en", "last_edit_date": "2024-01-01", "num_tokens": 283}

Then why did banks not serve these markets prior to\nthe reform? Two reasons can explain this pattern.\nFirst, on the revenue side, monopolistic competition and downward-sloping demand curves\nimply that banks can maximize their markups and hence their profits by restricting quantities,\nwhich will restrict bank expansion.45The limit on bank network expansion will be amplified\nwhen the uncertainty about the profitability of possible markets is high (e.g., Hellmann,\nMurdock, and Stiglitz, 1997), which is likely the case for many smaller cities in a developing", "article_title": "FinancialInclusionEvidenceBrazil", "full_section_title": "", "block_type": "text", "language": "en", "last_edit_date": "2024-01-01", "num_tokens": 340}

Maximizing bank mark-up will result in cities not having a branch under the hypothesis that the geo-\ngraphical market served by a branch can be larger than the administrative unit \u201ccity.\u201d While our data does\nnot allow us to provide direct evidence, this idea is consistent with our results on distance to bank branches\nacross cities in Section 5.2.2 and in line with the findings in Assuncao, Mityakov, and Townsend (2020).\n46. This puzzling feature of limited bank expansion to lower margin but profitable markets is actually a\nfeature that has been found in many countries, including developed countries with an active financial sector\nlike the US.

We evaluate quantitatively the policy impacts of relaxing each of\nthese constraints separately, and in combination, on GDP and inequality. We focus on three dimensions\nof financial inclusion: access (determined by the size of participation costs), depth (determined by\nthe size of collateral constraints resulting from limited commitment), and intermediation efficiency\n(determined by the size of interest rate spreads and default possibilities due to costly monitoring).\nWe take the model to firm-level data from the World Bank Enterprise Survey and World Development\nIndicators for six countries at varying degrees of economic development \u2013 three low income countries\n(Uganda, Kenya, Mozambique), and three emerging market countries (Malaysia, the Philippines, and\nEgypt). The results suggest that alleviating different financial frictions have a differential impact across\ncountries, with country-specific characteristics playing a central role in determining the linkages and\ntrade-offs among inclusion, GDP, inequality, and the distribution of gains and losses.\nEra Dabla-Norris\nInternational Monetary Fund", "article_title": "DistiguishingFinancialConstraints", "full_section_title": "", "block_type": "text", "language": "en", "last_edit_date": "2024-01-01", "num_tokens": 304}

The record on \fnancial inclusion, however, has not kept apace. Large amounts of credit\ndo not always correspond to broad use of \fnancial services, as credit is often concentrated among\nthe largest \frms. Moreover, \frms in developing countries evidently continue to face barriers in\naccessing \fnancial services. For instance, 95 percent of \frms in advanced economies have access to\na bank loan or line of credit as compared with 58 percent in developing economies, and 20 percent\nin low-income countries (Figure I). Collateral requirements for loans, which impose borrowing\nconstraints on \frms, are also 2-3 times as high in developing countries as compared to advanced\neconomies. Similarly, interest rate spreads (the di\u000berence between lending and deposit rates) tend\nto be much higher than in advanced economies.

Moreover, there is a need for better\nunderstanding of the economic channels through which these relationships are sustained. Given\nthat \fnancial inclusion is multi-dimensional, involving both participation barriers and \fnancial\nfrictions that constrain credit availability, policy implications to foster \fnancial inclusion are likely\nto vary across countries.

Empirical findings demonstrate significant growth in\nmanufacturing firms in these districts due to eased credit access, resulting in increased\ncapital accumulation, sales revenue, and employment. However, the expansion predom-\ninantly benefited incumbent firms, with minimal stimulation of firm entry or product\ninnovation. The reform also induced notable labor reallocation towards manufacturing\nsectors, particularly in areas with lower agricultural productivity. To fully understand\nthe aggregate effects of bank expansion and explore policy counterfactuals, we are de-\nveloping a general equilibrium model, which will be calibrated using our micro-level\nestimates.\n\u2020We would like to express our gratitude to Pete Klenow, Eric Verhoogen, and Jack Willis for their\ninvaluable guidance and support throughout the project.

An estimate\nfrom the World Bank posits that approximately 1.7 billion people, primarily residing in\nunderdeveloped countries, are devoid of basic banking facilities, such as checking accounts or\nstandardsavingsproducts( Demirguc-Kuntetal. ,2018). Thissituationstarklycontrastswith\ndeveloped economies like the United States, where a mere 4.5% of households are \u201cunbanked\u201d\n(FDIC,2021). This deprivation from finance could impede economic development by curbing\naggregate investment and employment and distorting capital allocation among firms and\npotential entrepreneurs ( Hsieh and Klenow ,2009;Buera et al. ,2011;Bazzi et al. ,2021;\nFonseca and Matray ,2022).\nMany developing countries have implemented place-based policies to stimulate bank ex-\npansion in lagging regions, believing that these policies have the potential to ignite economic\ngrowth and alleviate poverty through better access to financial services.

As a consequence, the reform might \u201ctrickle-\n28down\u201d to poor households and draw workers away from agriculture.35On the other hand,\nimproved access to finance could also stimulate agricultural investments, potentially increas-\ning the marginal productivity of agricultural labor.36Hence, the net effect on inter-sectoral\nlabor reallocation is ex-anteunclear.\nFurthermore, existing literature has highlighted substantial inter-sectoral labor mobility\ncosts in India, potentially confining labor to agriculture even in the face of low productiv-\nity.Munshi and Rosenzweig (2016) highlights that the wage gap between urban and rural", "article_title": "BankExpansionFirmDynamicsandStructural", "full_section_title": "", "block_type": "text", "language": "en", "last_edit_date": "2024-01-01", "num_tokens": 289}

(2021) investigates the effects of bank expansion also in the context of\nIndia, leveraging experimental evidence. Their study reveals that while bank expansion facilitated greater\naccess to loans for impoverished rural households, the recipients primarily used these loans for consumption\npurposes rather than for investment. Despite this consumption-focused utilization of loans, these households\nexperienced an increase in rural income. This outcome is potentially attributed to the \u201ctrickling-down\u201d\neffect: the heightened economic activity engendered by the expansion of banking services indirectly catalyzes\nan increase in local wages.\n36Agricultural investments and new technology can potentially lower the marginal productivity of labor,\nas exemplified by the case of Brazil\u2019s GE soybean seeds ( Bustos et al. ,2016).
