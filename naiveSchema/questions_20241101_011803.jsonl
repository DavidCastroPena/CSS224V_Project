Advancing Financial Inclusion in India beyond the Jan -Dhan Yojana. Brookings  \nIndia IMPACT Series. Brookings Institution India Center.  \n \nThe Brookings Institution India Center serves as a platform for cutti ng-edge, independent, policy -relevant \nresearch and analysis on the opportunities and challenges facing India and the world. The Center is based in \nNew Delhi, and registered as a company limited by shares and not for profit, under Section 25 of the \nCompanie s Act, 1956.   Established in 2013, the Center is the third and newest overseas center of the \nWashington, D.C. -based Brookings Institution. Our work is centered on the Brookings motto of \u201cQuality, \nIndependence, Impact.\u201d  \n \nAll content reflects the individual  views of the author(s).   Brookings India does not hold an institutional view on any subject.   \n THE BROOKINGS INDIA IMPACT  SERIES  \n \n \nBrookings India's fundamental objective is to contribute meaningfully to the process of designing \nsolutions for India's policy problems. We aspire to do this in a way which fully reflects the core values \nof analytical quality and independence of views. We believe that policy recommendations based on \nthese two attributes are most likely to have a positive impact on outcomes.  \n \nSince we began our activities in 2013, we have been active in three broad domains: Economic \nDevelopment, Foreign Policy, and Energy &  Environment. We have initiated research on several \nissues within these domains and, simultaneously, organized a regular series of conversations between \nvarious stakeholders, who bring their particular perspective to the discussions in a constructive way. \nThese activities have helped us to understand the nature of specific problems in each domain, gauge \nthe priority of the problem in terms of India's broad development and security agenda and develop a \nnetwork of people who think deeply about these issues.  \n \nWith the NDA government beginning to concretize its policy priorities and the methods and \ninstitutions with which it intends to address these critical issues, we at Brookings India see this as an \nopportunity to contribute to the policy thinking across a ra nge of issues. The Brookings India \nIMPACT Series represents our efforts to do this. In a series of policy papers that will be published \nand disseminated over the next three months, the authors will offer concrete recommendations for \naction on a variety of policy issues, emerging from succinct problem statements and diagnoses. We \nbelieve that these papers will both add value to process of policy formulation and to the broader public \ndebate amongst stakeholders, as opinion converges on practical and effective  solutions.  \n \nGiven Brookings India's current research focus, we are classifying the papers into three categories: \nDevelopment and Governance ; Foreign Policy ; and Energy and Environment . Many of the \npapers are written by Brookings India researchers, but, in  keeping with our objective of developing \nand sustaining a collaborative network, we have invited a few experts from outside the institution to \ncontribute to the series as well.  In the area of development and governance, the series will address \nissues suc h as poverty, financial inclusion, education, women\u2019s empowerment, infrastructure, and food \nsecurity. The area of foreign policy will focus on  countries, regions, and issues \u2013 including maritime \nsecurity, the nuclear order, multilateral cyber -crime, and re lations with the United States, China, and \nSouth -East Asia. Finally, essays in the area of energy and environment will cover oil and gas, coal, \nelectricity, nuclear, wind, and solar power, and energy security and governance.  \n  \nWe look forward to active en gagement with readers on the diagnoses and recommendations that these \npapers offer. Feedback can be sent directly to the authors.   \n \n \n  \n ADVANCING FINANCIAL INCLUSION IN INDIA BEYOND THE  \nJAN-DHAN YOJANA    \nKEY INSIGHTS  \n\uf0b7 Promote  financial  savings of poor households through innovative product design that matches \ntheir specific needs  \n\uf0b7 Bring indigenous 'bottom -up' financial institutions  such as registered Chit Funds, and the \nextensive postal network  into the fold of national financial inclusion strategy for greater impact  \n\uf0b7 Extend effort to pilot innovative insurance products and scale up successful insurance \ninstruments  \n\uf0b7 Encourage technology solutions that reduce operating costs of selling small ticket financial \ninstrument and s upport in novations in management practices of financial institutions to enable \nsustainable and robust financial i nclusion  \n\uf0b7 Galvanize financial literacy and awareness for bette r utilization of financial instruments and to \nreduce risks of dubious schemes  \nTHE AUTHORS  \nSHAMIKA RAVI is Fellow, Development Economics at Brookings India and Fellow, \nGlobal Economy and Development at the Brookings Institution.

The Finance Minister, in his budget speech for 2014 -15, laid out a specific set of targets to \nprovide for financial accounts to every household by  August 2015. This ambitious target set the tone \nas well as highlighted the importance of attaining it within a specified timeframe. Taking the ambition \nfurther, in his maiden Independence Day speech, the Prime Minister announced the Pradhan Mantri \nJan\u2013Dhan Yojana (PMJDY) with an objective of opening no -frills bank accounts. The PMJDY was \nlaunched immediately after this announcement on August 28. On the inauguration day itself, 1.5 crore \nbank accounts were opened. Within three months, the figure multiplied to 7.5 crore across India. This \nmust be recognised as a remarkable achievement.  \nThe focus of financial inclusion in India thus far has overwhelmingly been on delivering credit through \nmicrofinance channels, state -owned banks and through state -promoted self  help groups. The PMJDY \nhas complemented these efforts by forcefully accelerating the previous efforts of the Reserve Bank of \nIndia (RBI) of promoting financial inclusion through facilitating opening of bank accounts. The \nPMJDY provides basic zero -balance bank accounts with accident insurance cover of 1 lakh, along \nwith an overdraft facility of Rs 5,000 available for account holders. The scheme would also facilitate \nthe use of mobile banking among the poor through the National Unified USSD Platform (NUUP). \nThe NUUP would allow customers to access banking services using a single number across all banks, \nirrespective of the telecom provider or mobile handset being used (National Payments Corporation \nof India, 2014). The launch of this scheme received strong su pport from public sector and private \nsector commercial banks, resulting in significant uptake. With the provision of insurance and transfer \nfacilities along with the overdraft facilities under PMJDY, there is a clear focus on expanding the \nportfolio of fin ancial instruments available to all households in the country (Pradhan Mantri Jan \u2013\nDhan Yojana, 2014).  \nJust about a year ago, the RBI renewed its financial inclusion mandate with the formation of the Mor \nCommittee on Comprehensive Financial Services for Sma ll Businesses and Low Income Households \nin September 2013. The committee, whose objective was to provide a clear vision for financial \ninclusion, prepared a report highlighting key areas of concern. The recommendations of the \ncommittee included provision of  bank accounts to all citizens, setting up state finance regulatory \ncommissions and creation of a new entity in the financial system - payment banks.  Advancing Financial Inclusion in India beyond the Jan -Dhan Yojana  \n  \n \n4 \n Since then the RBI has issued two new full bank licenses and, in November 2014, released final rules \nfor setting up small banks and payment banks. Small banks will provide both deposits and loans, but \ngeared towards un -served and underserved segments such as small businesses and  marginal farmers. \nPayment banks will offer a limited set of products, mainly dema nd deposits and remittances and \ntransfers, and will not provide lending services.    \nThe recent policy measures undertaken by the Government and RBI have provided a much  needed \npush for financial inclusion in the country. However, there remain some key gap s and concerns that \nmust be addressed for attaining sustained comprehensive financial inclusion, especially of the low -\nincome population. We highlight these and discuss them in some detail in this paper.  \n \nA Brief Background of Financial Inclusion in India   \nAfter the World Wars, most developed nations vigorously implemented rural finance policies, which \nfocused primarily on the provision of subsidised credit to the rural population, through state -\ncontrolled or directed institutions. Indian policies on rural f inance have mirrored the worldwide \npattern since the 1950s with the implementation of various forms of subsidised credit schemes, \nincluding the mammoth Integrated Rural Development Programme (IRDP). The basis of extending \nsubsidised credit is the theory in  development economics which claims that access to capital can lead \nto increased income and reduced poverty. The critical assumption of that model is that all households \nhave a project to invest in and it is only the lack of collateral that prevents banks from lending to the \npoor. It was exactly this fundamental logic which led to the innovation of different kinds of collateral \nsubstitutes like joint liability which formed the basis for the microcredit revolution worldwide, \nparticularly in South Asia.  \nHowe ver, it is now well recognized that financial needs of the \u2018excluded\u2019 segments of the economy go \nbeyond access to credit. Improved access to various formal financial services includes safe instruments \nfor savings, easy -to-understand insurance instruments, and pension and transfer facilities, among \nothers. These can enable consumption smoothing, building an asset base which can facilitate future \naccess to credit and risk management and be used for self -investment in micro enterprises.  \nThe main demand -side b arriers to the provision of financial services to the poor are the lack of \nawareness, limited financial literacy, and limited access. Most products offered by banks are unsuitable                                                                                                                              Brookings India IMPACT Series   \n   \n5 \n for the poor and come attached with terms and conditions which prove to be b urdensome, further \ndampening the demand for these services. At the same time, as recent events (for example, the Saradha \nscam) have shown, lack of financial literacy can result in people making wrong choices, and becoming \nvulnerable to excessive financial risks.  \nFrom the supply side, the main barrier to the provision of formal financial services is transaction cost. \nData reveals that a large number of bank accounts are underused, which makes creating and \nmaintaining such accounts cost -ineffective for the b anks. From the credit perspective, the lack of \ncollateral makes lending to small borrowers costly for banks and other formal financial institutions. \nSmall ticket sizes add to the per instrument transaction costs. Furthermore, lacunae in physical and \nlegal infrastructure make it difficult to extend and enforce contracts.  \n \nWhat do the poor want?  \nMost of the poor, urban and rural, lack access to basic financial services and address their need for \nfinancial products through informal means which are costly and unsecure. Financial inclusion aims to \nreduce such risks, and provide safer options to them, but over the years the various policies adopted \nby the government to increase the presence of banks in remote rural areas have still not been able to \ncover the majo rity of the population. Those who have been provided with no -frills bank accounts lack \nthe incentive to utilize these accounts to save money. Most of the strategies of the government in \npromoting financial inclusion have been centred on the provision of ba nk accounts in order to \nfacilitate credit to the poor. The provision of credit, though important, is not the only means through \nwhich the poor can be included in the economy through financial services.  \nUnderstanding how the poor earn and manage their mone y can help in designing better instruments \nand institutions to address their financial needs. In Portfolios of the Poor , Collins et al. (2009) aim to do \nthis through the use of \u2018financial diaries\u2019.  The authors interviewed poor households in Bangladesh, \nIndia, and South Africa twice a month for a year, asking a series of questions which were then \nconstructed into \u2018financial diaries\u2019 to understand how the poor spent their money. The poor in \ndeveloping countries like India, face three main issues or a \u2018triple  whammy\u2019 \u2014 low incomes, lack of \nappropriate financial tools, and unpredictable outcomes. It is these challenges which financial Advancing Financial Inclusion in India beyond the Jan -Dhan Yojana  \n  \n \n6 \n inclusion initiatives must address. This research found three main areas where poor households would \nfrequently find the need to  generate resources through financial tools . \nLump sums of cash : In order to invest in microenterprises and agricultural activities, the poor need to \ngenerate large sums of money to purchase fertilizers or invest in human capital such as healthcare, \nschool fees and weddings. However, there are constraints on the ability to generate such large sums. \nHence, they require financial instruments that meet these needs by helping them \u2018save up\u2019 to a lump \nsum amount.  \nDaily expenditure : Funding for day -to-day expendi ture is a need that the poor face, and is often \nunaddressed by the financial institutions, unlike the provision of lump sum of money. This need is \nmost acute for those farmers who receive a few lump sums over the year. However, these sums of \nmoney are almo st immediately used up. There is a need to set some money aside in the months of no \nincome and also for future expenditure. This need is also important for other categories of workers \nwho receive intermittent income, like daily labourers, in order to bridg e gaps in earnings. Therefore, \nthe provision of financial services, such as savings bank accounts, can be instrumental in cash flow \nmanagement for households. Having secure and accessible savings accounts can help them in \nconsumption smoothing to a great e xtent.  \nUnexpected circumstances : A situation in which the poor often find themselves unable to provide are \nunavoidable crises like adverse weather conditions and health emergencies. These negative shocks \ndrive the marginal poor back into poverty by forcing  them to resort to borrowing from informal \nsources such as moneylenders or to sell assets. Risk exposure can also dis -incentivi se them from \ninvesting in activities which could yield higher productivity. Access to insurance instruments as well \nas savings ca n provide a buffer in times of extreme shocks such that they don\u2019t resort to costly \nincome \u2013smoothing activities.  \n \nAdvancing Financial Inclusion in India beyond Jan \u2013Dhan Yojana   \nWith most financial inclusion policies in India solely focused on the provision  of bank accounts and \ncredit to the poor, there is a need to include more financial services in the portfolio of national financial \ninclusion strategies to account for the needs of this segment. We highlight some of these below and \nemphasize that they be p rioritized.                                                                                                                               Brookings India IMPACT Series   \n   \n7 \n 1. Innovation in savings instruments  \nThe financial portfolios of poor households are as diverse as those of their richest peers, with an \naverage of 10 financial instruments per household (Collins et al., 2009). However, the diversity of \nfinancial  instruments offered in India today by commercial finance companies as well as the \ngovernment is limited in scope and scale, particularly to the poorer sections of society. Product design \nis critically important when it comes to developing savings instrume nts for low -income households . \nThe instruments provided and facilitated by the financial  sector, from the government to the banks to \nlocal state authorities must be designed according to the needs of the specific market segment.  \nInternationally, the success of Bank Rakyat Indonesia (BRI) in providing commercially viable financial \nservices \u2013 loans and savings, along with other financial products to the low -income households \u2013 has \nseveral lessons for India. BRI built a customer base  of over 30 million depositors through tailoring \ntheir products and services offered to the needs of the clients, thereby incentivizing them to better \nutilize their savings accounts. BRI accounts are structured in a way which encourages more savings \nthan l oans. The management practices at the BRI have also been innovative such that each bank unit \n(branch) functions as an independent entity with its own targets and employee reward policies. These \ninnovations in product and management practices have collectiv ely made the BRI a long term \nprofitable bank with the distinction of being one of the few large banks in the region which survived \nthe East Asian financial crisis. Thailand\u2019s largest state owned bank - Bank of Agriculture and \nAgricultural Cooperatives (BAAC ) -followed BRI\u2019s lead and there are discussions of bank reforms in \nChina along the BRI model.  \nAnother savings product that received tremendous attention was developed to incentivize the poor \nand is called the SEED (Save, Earn, and Enjoy Deposits) account, implemented by the Green Bank \nof Caraga in the Philippines (Ashraf et al., 2006). The SEED acc ount provides individuals with a \ncommitment which restricts their savings. The individual sets a goal, either a date or amount he/she \nwants to save, and is subsequently unable to withdraw money from the account until that goal is \nreached. Such measures giv e people the option to \u2018force\u2019 themselves into saving and it also stresses \nthe importance of longer term financial goals and discipline for households. These are critical for the \ndevelopment of viable financial markets at the bottom of the pyramid.  \nExtendi ng products from the mainstream financial sector into the financially excluded segment can \nbe risky. Financial institutions must be encouraged to develop innovative products and services, and Advancing Financial Inclusion in India beyond the Jan -Dhan Yojana  \n  \n \n8 \n move away from the one -size-fits-all recipe. This can be achieve d through encouraging innovation \nand ensuring competition amongst the financial service providers in India.  \n2. Indigenous institutions of financial inclusion  \nResearch has shown that Chit Funds are widespread in India and have the appeal of a \u201cbottom -up\u201d \napproach to financial inclusion, aimed at providing low -income households the means through which \nthey can meet their financial needs. However, these institutions have so far been excluded from the \nformal financial sector, largely due to ignorance. In most par ts of India, very large groups of people \nparticipate in different forms of informal regular savings -credit arrangements with each other. Under \na chit fund scheme, a group of individuals comes together and pool in money, and at the end of each \nmonth  (or a s pecified period), the pool of money is loaned out to individuals from among that group. \nIn this aspect, it acts as an efficient circulation of money between those who want to save and others \nwho want to borrow. It also serves as an accessible option of ins urance during financial duress.  \nChit Funds in India have been in operation for thousands of years \u2013 they were first established as \ninformal associations of traders and households within communities. They work in a similar way to \nthe Rotating Savings and C redit Associations (ROSCA) which are prevalent in most countries of the \nworld, in some form or the other, allowing people to save and borrow simultaneously. India has \nformally institutionalized Chit Funds through the Chit Fund Act, 1982, enabling legally r ecognized \ninstitutions the means to provide a variety of chit schemes. The industry under the Act is highly \nregulated with stringent rules in place.  \nAccording to a report by the Institute for Financial Management and Research (IFMR) (Kapoor et al., \n2011), more than 90% of the population surveyed held bank accounts. To be able to participate in \nchit funds, a person should hold a savings account wherein cheques can be deposited \u2014 almost \neveryone in the states surveyed have savings accounts. However, according  to an RBI study, 87% of \nthese accounts in a particular district were inactive. Banks have little incentives to promote the use of \nsuch savings accounts. The RBI had promoted the use of no -frills bank accounts which require a low \nminimum balance, and banks  perceive such accounts to be less than desirable. It was also found that \nChit Funds are the preferred mode of savings for over 40% of members, with 11% of the overall \npopulation preferring them for loans due to lower interest rates compared to banks.                                                                                                                               Brookings India IMPACT Series   \n   \n9 \n The most common reason for participating in Chit Fund schemes was to save, with consumption \nand/or business requirements a close second. The requirements change with the income levels of the \nindividual. As the income level of members increase, the proportion of people bidding in these chit \nschemes for business investment increases, though the opposite holds true when it comes to \nconsumption needs. The results from the research study show strong positive implications for Chit \nFunds as a source of savings and bo rrowing for poor households in India.  \nIt is now well established that Chit Funds are catering to those segments of the economy which are \nyet to be satisfactorily catered by Microfinance Institutions and Banks. They have tremendous \npotential to complement e conomic policies aimed at promoting entrepreneurship at low income levels \nand facilitating growth. They must, therefore, be part of the national financial inclusion strategies of \nthe government.  \nThe policy recommendation is to recognize the importance of Chit Funds and to galvanize financial \nliteracy among the investing public, media and financial regulators \u2013 with an aim to educate them \nabout the difference between Chit Funds and other deposit taking companies like Collective \nInvestment Schemes, Multileve l Marketing Companies and Prize Chits.  A critical first move in this \ndirection would be to initiate the Amendment of the Chit Fund Act 1982, making it more user friendly \nand thereby encouraging the unregistered sector to fall in line with the organised se ctor. \nOur analysis of a recently conducted geo -spatial survey of financial service providers1 in Uttar Pradesh \nand Bihar shows that households have the best access to post offices, measured in physical distance. \nOn an average households are 2 kilometres  from the nearest post office while the distance to the \nnearest bank customer service point is 1.5 times as much; the distance to ATMs is 3 times as much \nwhile the nearest MFI is more than 10 times farther. This would suggest that financial inclusion \nstrategies of the government should ideally leverage the already existing and extensive postal network \nin the country. Post offices offer few financial services currently but these must be augmented. \nParticularly because the original mandate of postal departmen t has weakened with improved digital \nand telecom footprint across India.  \n3. Insurance instruments  \nInsurance is a critical component for financial inclusion of the poor, vulnerable sections of the \npopulation. It has not enjoyed the same prominence in policy me asures as credit and bank accounts  \n                                                           \n1 Survey conducted by Brand Fusion and supported by Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation  Advancing Financial Inclusion in India beyond the Jan -Dhan Yojana  \n  \n \n10 \n in India. As mentioned previously, the main needs for the poor are to have safety nets in order to \nprovide for any unexpected circumstances, to hold lump sum money, and to provide day -to-day \nexpenses. Besides tapping into  savings, these needs can only be met through well -designed and easy -\nto-understand insurance products, including health, life, property, crop and myriads of other insurance \ninstruments meant to mitigate different forms of shocks.   \nOur previous research in dicates that though the access to credit and savings instruments can serve as \ninsurance mechanisms along with societal arrangements of reciprocity, these are expensive in \ncomparison to access to insurance instruments (Ravi, 2006). The new PMJDY provides so me forms \nof insurance but is limited to accident and life. Launched in 2008, Rashtriya Swasthya Bima Yojana \n(RSBY) aims to provide health insurance coverage to all below poverty line (BPL) families in India. \nTill date more than 37 million BPL families have  been enrolled in this health insurance scheme but it \nremains to be seen whether it is an effective tool to protect poor households from health shocks. \nPrevious research has shown that limited understanding of health insurance results in a significantly \nlower claims to coverage ratio for the low income segment ( Ravi & Rai , 2011).  \nThe Agriculture Insurance Company was set up in 2002 with the sole motive of promoting insurance \ncover to farmers in India. They have since rolled out three main schemes \u2013 yield b ased national \nagriculture insurance scheme, national crop insurance program and the weather based crop insurance \nscheme. Given that crop insurance has suffered financially at the global level, it might be worthwhile \nto take stock of India\u2019s performance. Al so, insurance cover to the rural poor has to extend beyond \ncrops to livestock, property and weather insurance because  a significant part of the rural population \nis employed in microenterprises and face income shocks. Government effort should be extended \ntowards pilot testing  these products and scaling up those financial instrumen ts that have  proven to be \nsuccessful.  \nSome sophisticated insurance products like the weather insurance (rainfall insurance) have fallen far \nshort of the intended take up levels, de spite being well designed. The common belief is that lack of \nfinancial literacy and awareness makes selling insurance instruments a tricky business and often a \nprohibitively expensive one, particularly to the poor. People are often confused between savings  and \ninsurance instruments and there have been several reported instances of poor households wanting to \nwithdraw their insurance premiums.  \n                                                                                                                              Brookings India IMPACT Series   \n   \n11 \n 4. Technology  \nTechnology has been the key in reducing the problem of access to banking services, and with schemes \nsuch as the PMJDY, providing access should no t be among the major challenges . The technological \noptions are now wide ranging, and with India\u2019s booming telecom sector, the option of using mobile \npayments as a means for financial inclusion is feasible. According  to the latest data released by the \nTelecom Regulatory Authority of India, the total number of mobile subscribers in India is around 900 \nmillion. Therefore, telecom companies have emerged as a viable tool to achieve financial inclusion. In \nKenya, M -Pesa is  one example of how mobile technology is used to complete banking transactions. \nThe core idea of businesses such as M -Pesa rests solely on the facilitation of financial transactions via \nmobile phones. Under this system, customers can transfer money directl y between accounts as well \nas between other customers as well, as long as both parties have M -Pesa (Kapoor et al., 2007).  \n \nConclusion  \nExpanding access to financial services seems to hold promise as a means for including the poor, \nreducing poverty, and spurring economic development (Karlan & Murdoch, 2010). With the \nannouncement of the SVS financial inclusion blueprint by the government under which the PMJDY \nwas launched, and the new payment bank guidelines suggested by the RBI, there is hope that financ ial \ninclusion is a clearer and important mandate in the country. Both these measures emphasize the \nprovision of bank accounts, which is an essential factor, but only a limited one towards achieving \nfinancial inclusion in India.  \nIn the past decades, state policies of financial inclusion have overwhelmingly relied on extending credit \nto low -income households through subsidized credit schemes like IRDP or expanding SHGs and \nproviding no -frills bank accounts. Private sector initiatives like the significant exp ansion of \nmicrofinance activities in India have also shown the limited scope within which lenders functioned. \nResearch has shown that unless financial instruments are designed for specific needs of the poor, they \nremain underutilized and costly for the pro viders, and therefore, non -sustainable. Broader financial \nneeds of the poor have so far been met through informal means which are costly and risky and result \nin sub optimal outcomes for the most vulnerable sections of our society. Allowing and encouraging Advancing Financial Inclusion in India beyond the Jan -Dhan Yojana  \n  \n \n12 \n innovation in savings instruments for the poor by the formal financial sector is thus critical to \nachieving our goals of financial inclusion.  \nTo complement such innovation, indigenous financial institutions must find a place within the \nfinancial inclusion policies of the government. These are old institutions based on established social \nnetworks. Our policies must incorporate these and facilitate further healthy growth of such indigenous \ninstitutions. We must also actively seek to understand these instituti ons to shape a regulatory policy \nrather than shun all out of ignorance. They have a far greater reach and acceptance amongst the people \nthan most top -down policies of financial inclusion in the recent history of liberalized India.  \nGovernment policies must  recognize this and build on the strengths of indigenous financial \ninstitutions. For similar reasons, post offices must also be brought within the fold of national financial \ninclusion strategy due to their extensive network and greater accessibility.  \nRaising awareness and imparting financial literacy are also critical to the utilization of financial \ninstruments and for better financial decision -making.

Bank branch\nproximity mitigates the transaction costs of mobilizing savings from many agents, which\ncan increase the capital available to entrepreneurs. Branch proximity also lowers the cost to\nbanks of screening and monitoring entrepreneurs, and of providing access to liquidity services.\nHowever, setting up bank branches is not only costly but also risky, as demand for deposits\nand loans can only be observed after the creation of the branch, which can lead to an under-\nprovision of financial services.\nFor this reason, policymakers across the world have sought to promote financial inclu-\nsion by implementing large-scale reforms to expand the physical networks of bank branches.1\nThe popularity of these financial inclusion policies raises multiple questions: do they suc-\nceed in promoting financial and economic development and, if so, how? And what are the\ndistributional consequences of such policies?\nIn this paper, we trace out the dynamic effects on both economic development and wage\ninequality of a government program that improved access to mainstream financial services.\nWe use the introduction of the \u201cBanks for All\u201d program ( \u201cBanco para Todos\u201d ) by the Brazil-\nian federal government in 2004, which explicitly targeted underbanked cities by introducing\nbranches of government-owned banks. This policy constitutes a unique natural experiment\nfeaturing a large, plausibly exogenous shock to financial access and capital deepening at the\nlevel of entire labor markets.\nOur empirical analysis combines Brazilian administrative employer-employee data cover-\ning the universe of formal employees in Brazil with detailed bank branch balance sheets from\n2000\u20132014. In a difference-in-differences research design, we compare the evolution of various\noutcomes in cities benefiting from this policy (those with no government-owned banks prior\nto the reform) relative to unaffected cities. We use a parsimonious matching procedure to\nselect control cities for each treated city, where we match on the pre-reform population quin-\ntile and Gini growth, and we estimate the effect of financial development on employment,\nentrepreneurship, firm growth, average wage, and wage inequality.\nOur identification strategy exploits ex-ante differences in the presence of government-\nowned banks across cities, but it does notrequire the initial presence of government-owned\nbanks to be random. It only requires that outcomes of treated and control cities would\nhave evolved similarly absent the reform. While, by definition, this identifying assumption is\nuntestable, we provide a battery of tests that are supportive of it, which we discuss in detail\n1. Examples include China in the 1970s, India in the 1980s, Thailand in the 1980s and 1990s.\n2after summarizing our results. Specifically, we: (i) show evidence of pre-reform parallel trends\nfor our key city-level outcomes, (ii) show that our matching procedure leads to covariate\nbalance across a wide array of city-level characteristics not targeted by the matching, (iii)\ndirectly control for city characteristics pre-reform, (iv) employ a city-by-industry difference-\nin-differences estimator to control for sector-specific shocks that could differentially impact\ncities exposed to the policy. The stability of point estimates across the different strategies\nimplies our results cannot be explained by differential exposure to aggregate or city-specific\nshocks.\nWe start by showing that the reform leads to financial inclusion and financial development.\nAfter 2004, the number of bank branches increases in treated cities, leading to an inflow of\nlocal deposits and an increase in credit supply of similar magnitude. The similar expansion\nin local deposits and credit points to an increase in the amount of capital available to local\nfirms, rather than a reallocation of capital to treated cities from other regions of the country.2\nThe increases in total bank branches, deposits, and credit do not mean revert but instead\nshift to a new, higher steady state. This implies better access to external funding and liq-\nuidity services, both of which can foster economic development.3Consistent with the policy\ndriving this shift in the steady state of financial development, these increases are driven by\ngovernment-owned banks, whose expansion only modestly crowds out private banks. The\nabsence of an effect on private credit can be seen as a placebo test, showing that our results\nare not driven by differential exposure of treated cities to economy-wide shocks experienced\nby Brazil during this period.\nOur second set of results is about the average effect of the reform on economic development.\nWe show that the reform leads to an increase in employment by 10%, mostly driven by an\nexpansion of smaller firms. Increased labor demand pushes up the average wage per worker\nby 4.1%. Looking at firm dynamics, we find that the reform-induced bank branch expansion\nfosters entrepreneurship, as the number of firms increases by roughly 10%. This increase masks\nan even higher acceleration of underlying firm dynamism, as both firm entry and firm exit rate\nincrease. While these results only reflect patterns in the formal sector, entrepreneurial activity\nand firm growth in the formal sector are of first-order importance for economic development,\nas the transition from subsistence to transformational entrepreneurs and the integration of\nworkers in the formal sector foster economic growth (e.g., Dix-Carneiro, Goldberg, Meghir,\nand Ulyssea, 2021). Nonetheless, we show in robustness checks that our results are not driven\nby firms and workers moving from the informal sector to the formal sector.\n2. As additional evidence that capital is not flowing from control cities to treated cities, we show that credit\ngrowth does not slow down in control cities around the time of the reform.\n3. See Yang and Xu (2022) for an example of how access to liquidity services thanks to bank branch\nexpansion promoted development in 19th-century US.\n3The richness of our data allows us to examine the mechanisms that link financial in-\nclusion and economic development. Financial inclusion could foster growth by increasing\naggregate demand by improving households\u2019 access to credit and by allowing households to\nbetter smooth their consumption, thereby reducing the need for precautionary saving. We\nrule out this local demand channel as the main driver of our results by showing that employ-\nment growth is mostly driven by firms in the tradable sector, which are by definition less\ndependent on local demand.\nSo why would financial inclusion promote entrepreneurship and firm growth? We show\nthat the policy-induced increase in financial inclusion works by reducing the physical distance\nbetween banks and entrepreneurs. Indeed, the positive effect of the reform increases propor-\ntionally with the distance between treated cities and the closest city with a bank branch prior\nto the reform and is larger for smaller firms, which likely face bigger informational frictions.\nThese gains are the same whether the nearest bank is private or public, suggesting that our\nresults are not driven by particulars of how public banks operate (e.g., by access to subsidized\nor politically-motivated loans). Instead, these results are consistent with the distance to bank\nbranches affecting access to liquidity, and with models in which the distance between borrow-\ners and lenders affects the cost of credit either because it reduces screening and monitoring\ncosts (e.g., Greenwood and Jovanovic, 1990; Townsend and Ueda, 2006), in particular when\nsoft information is prevalent (e.g., Petersen and Rajan, 1994,; Hombert and Matray, 2017).\nOur third set of results is about the distributional effects of the reform. We find that the\npolicy leads to a sizable increase in wage inequality within treated cities. This is explained\nby the fact that, although all workers are better off after the reform, the magnitude of wage\ngains rises monotonically with the position of workers in the wage distribution. Our detailed\npanel data of workers allow us to show that this increase is not driven by a change in the\nsample composition, but instead reflects an increase in wages holding fixed individuals\u2019 sex,\nage, education, occupation, and sectoral specialization. We also show that our results are\nquantitatively unchanged when we restrict our sample to workers that we observe throughout\nthe sample period and to firms already in the data prior to the reform. These sample restric-\ntions allow us to show that our results are not driven by workers entering the formal sector\nafter the reform or more general changes in the sample composition of worker characteristics.\nWe then explore two explanations that can account for the rise in inequality. First, fi-\nnancial development could increase the relative demand for skilled labor, either because of a\nlarge fixed component to the cost of skilled labor (e.g., Benmelech, Bergman, and Seru, 2021;\nSchoefer, 2021) or because the relative productivity of skilled workers increases with financial\ndevelopment (Fonseca and Doornik, 2021). Models that assume that financial development\nincreases the relative productivity of skilled workers or loosens constraints on the demand\n4for skilled workers generally predict that the equilibrium skill mix should change, with firms\nincreasing the share of skilled workers in their workforce. However, when looking at the effect\nof the policy on the average skill composition of firms, we find that the share of skilled workers\ndoes not increase in treated cities.\nInstead, we find support for another explanation: skills are scarce, especially in developing\ncountries, which means that the supply of skilled workers is more inelastic than that of\nunskilled workers in the short run. We show that cities in our setting are characterized by\nhigh internal migration costs and that the reform does not induce worker migration to treated\ncities. This lack of inter-city mobility implies that an increase in labor demand can only be\nserved by the supply of local workers. Consistent with skilled workers being in short supply,\nwe find that all the increase in inequality is concentrated in cities where a lower fraction of\nthe population is educated prior to the reform.\nWe consider a wide range of robustness checks. We start by showing that our results\nare quantitatively unchanged when we use different matching procedures. We then discuss\nthreats to identification. Our strategy faces two key threats. First, even in the absence of\npre-trends, treated cities may be ex-ante different in ways that differentially expose them to\naggregate shocks post-2004. That would be the case if, for instance, treated cities are ex-\nante more exposed to the commodity boom of the mid-2000s. Second, our policy might have\ncoincided with shocks that specifically affected treated cities, such as idiosyncratic shocks to\nbanks entering treated cities or a targeted expansion of welfare programs.\nWe address the threat produced by ex-ante differences in three ways. (i) We show that\nour matched treatment and control groups are similar over a rich array of city characteristics\nthat were not included in the matching process, including exposure to the commodity sector,\nskilled employment, political affiliation, size of the informal sector, or the co-movement of\nlocal GDP with aggregate fluctuations. While common support in levels is not required for\ndifferences-in-differences designs, such similarity makes the common-trend assumption more\nplausible, as these similarities in the level of characteristics make it less likely that they reacted\ndifferently to broader macroeconomic shocks post-2004.\nIn addition, (ii) we show that our results are quantitatively unchanged after directly con-\ntrolling for a wide range of pre-reform controls interacted with year fixed effects. Estimating\nall possible combinations of pre-reform controls across the hundreds of different specifica-\ntions yields very similar point estimates. Finally (iii), we exploit the granularity of our\ndata to build a city-by-industry difference-in-differences estimator. This allows us to include\nindustry-by-year fixed effects and non-parametrically control for any unobserved time-varying\nsector-specific shocks (e.g., commodity booms or trade shocks). Our coefficients of interest\nare estimated in this case by comparing the same sector across treated and control cities,\n5and therefore this strategy does not require that treated and control cities are similarly ex-\nposed to sector-specific shocks. We show that point estimates at the city-industry level are\nquantitatively similar to city-level estimates.\nOur setting also addresses a wide array of potential ex-post treated-specific shocks because,\nby construction, control cities already have a government-owned bank. Therefore, any shocks\nspecific to government-owned banks (such as an overall increase in lending by public banks)\nwill affect both treated and control cities at the same time and will be absorbed by our\ndifference-in-differences specification. This design also addresses the possibility that welfare\nprogram expansions might differentially benefit treated cities, since some of the largest welfare\nprograms are distributed by one of the public banks already present in control cities (including\nthe largest at the time, Bolsa Fam\u00b4 \u0131lia ). Therefore, an expansion of these programs would also\naffect both treated and control cities. In additional robustness tests, we show that results\nare robust to including state-by-year, which controls for state-level shocks such as differences\nin state-administered welfare programs. At the municipality level, our effects are unchanged\nwhen we compare treated and control cities with the same political affiliation or directly\ncontrol for the observed changes in expenditures.\nWe end the paper by discussing how our reduced-form identified coefficients can provide\nuseful causal moments for the macro-finance development literature and speak to potentially\nimportant frictions or sources of heterogeneity that future models could incorporate. Our\npaper shows the importance of explicitly linking distance to the nearest bank to the cost and\navailability of credit as in the structural model of Ji, Teng, and Townsend (2023). We provide\ncausal estimates of how changes in distance can affect credit supply and savings in interest-\nbearing products, as well as their impact on employment, firm growth, and firm entry. We\nalso provide moments linking changes in the supply of credit and real outcomes, which relate\nto key parameters in macro-development models in which a reduced-form collateral constraint\naffects economic growth. The considerably larger effects we find for treated cities in banking\ndeserts point toward the existence of a non-linearity around very low levels of external finance,\nsomething that is usually not explicitly modeled and could help to reconcile different results\nin the literature. Finally, our paper highlights the importance of worker heterogeneity and\nconstraints on the supply of human capital in accounting for the dynamics of wage inequality\nas a result of financial development in macro-finance models.\nLiterature Our paper contributes to several strands of literature. The closest one is on the\nrole of financial inclusion on financial intermediation costs and economic development, which\nplays a central role in macro-development models, but for which we have limited causally\n6estimates elasticities that can be tightly linked with model parameters.4\nOur setting allows us to better understand why financial inclusion fosters economic growth\nand provide new insights on the distributional effects of such policies. First, our high-quality\nadministrative data allow us to study many new margins through which financial inclusion\npolicies can foster development. Because we can observe the universe of formal economic\nactivity and track workers and firms over time, we can study a host of new outcomes: the\nprocess of creative destruction (firm entry and exit rate), the evolution of firm size distribution\nand the differential benefit for small vs. large firms measured pre-reform, as well as the\nevolution of sectoral composition (and in particular the relative growth of tradable vs. non-\ntradable sectors). Because we observe the universe of workers and can track them over time,\nwe can also shed light on the evolution of the skill premium and wage inequality, accounting\nfor changes in sample composition, and the interaction between financial inclusion policies\nand constraints on the accumulation of human capital.\nThe literature on the effect of bank branch presence has so far mostly focused on developed\neconomies and studied financial outcomes such as credit or wealth accumulation. The litera-\nture on developing countries has mostly focused on the introduction of specific bank branches\nin localized markets and used short-run cross-sectional survey data to study real outcomes\nand find small, short-lived positive effects or even negative effects.5By contrast, our ad-\nministrative panel data allow us to track the long-run effect of the policy on the full causal\nchain linking financial inclusion to financial development (credit supply, access to liquidity\nservices); real outcomes (employment, sectoral growth, average wages, entry and exit rates\nof firms, firm size distribution) and the distributional consequences of this financial-inclusion\ndriven economic growth.\nSecond, the policy-driven expansion of bank branches happens through profitable, publicly\nowned commercial banks rather than development-focused state banks with specific sectoral\nand poverty reduction mandates as in the Indian experiment (Burgess and Pande, 2005; Cole,\n2009). The policy also induced large variation at a sufficiently large geographical level to es-\ntimate \u201clocal general equilibrium effects,\u201d but sufficiently small to provide precise estimates.6\n4. See for instance Greenwood and Jovanovic (1990); Greenwood, Sanchez, and Wang (2010); Ji, Teng,\nand Townsend (2023), where geographical distance to a bank branch governs financial intermediation costs\nand the returns to saving. We provide a clear discussion of the connection between our estimates and the\nmacro-development models in Section 8\n5. See Bruhn and Love (2014); Burgess and Pande (2005); Fe Cramer (2022) for positive effects and Kochar\n(2011) for negative effects. A complementary approach exploits randomized controlled trials to study the im-\nplications of access to microcredit and savings products in developing countries. The literature on microcredit\nis surveyed in Banerjee, Karlan, and Zinman (2015), which concludes that microcredit has \u201cmodestly positive,\nbut not transformative, effects\u201d.\n6. By contrast Bruhn and Love (2014) studies the opening of outlets of a bank specialized for low-income in\nsupermarkets, while Burgess and Pande (2005) uses state-level variations across Indian states. More generally,\nmost of the literature on developing countries has used randomized controlled trial and shocks to specific banks\n7This level of analysis coupled with data on the universe of bank branch networks in Brazil\nallows us to provide the first causal estimate of the role of distance to financial services, a\nkey parameter in macro-development models that analyze the role of banks, and to highlight\nthat financial inclusion is not a dichotomous concept but should instead be thought of as\ncontinuous.\nTaken together, our results have several policy implications. First, financial inclusion poli-\ncies can generate large effects on economic development, even while banks operate profitable\nbranches. Second, these policies can have large distributive effects, in particular as they in-\nteract with constraints on human capital accumulation. Third, the initial distance to existing\nbank branches matters for the expected gains in terms of economic development. Therefore,\nfinancial inclusion policies can reap larger benefits at lower costs by carefully taking into\naccount the initial network of bank branches, which is important given the large number of\npolicies around the world attempting to foster economic development by promoting financial\ninclusion.\nThis paper also contributes to the empirical literature using natural experiments to show\nhow financial frictions, broadly defined, affect economic development.7Most of the evidence\nfor developing countries studies short-run capital injections that originate outside the city\nand focuses on changes in credit, holding fixed the network of banks .8Our paper highlights\na fundamentally different mechanism and our object of interest is the promotion of financial\ninclusion by expanding the network of bank branches . This branch expansion fosters the\nmobilization and pooling of local savings to start a virtuous circle between increased deposits,\nhigher credit, and economic development, originating from within the city as the distance\nbetween depositors, lenders, and borrowers is reduced. Therefore, our results imply that how\ncredit is distributed across places can matter as much as how much credit is distributed.\nThird, we contribute to the literature that studies the effect of financial development on\nwage inequality. Theoretical work in this literature focuses mostly on wealth inequality or total\nwith a focus on directly affected bank clients. The positive effects on non-clients are potentially a key driver\nof multiplier effects, which can account for why we find large positive effects on economic development while\nmost papers find limited effects.\n7. An earlier literature looks at how financial frictions relate to economic development using cross-country\nevidence. This literature is for instance reviewed in Beck and Levine (2018). See Buera, Kaboski, and Shin\n(2011), Buera and Shin (2013), or Midrigan and Xu (2014) for macro-models linking financial frictions and\ndevelopment and the survey in Buera, Kaboski, and Shin (2015). See also Xu (2022) and Xu2022 (Xu2022)\nand references therein for the importance of financial frictions in cross-country trade and growth, and long-run\nhistorical contexts.\n8. For instance shocks to the liquidity of lenders coming from targeted lending programs in India (Banerjee\nand Duflo, 2014) and Brazil (Bazzi, de Freitas Oliveira, Muendler, and Rauch, 2021), deposit volatility\n(Choudhary and Limodio, 2022), large government grants in Thai villages (e.g., Kaboski and Townsend, 2011;\nKaboski and Townsend, 2012), or broader financial market reforms such as bankruptcy reforms (e.g., Fonseca\nand Doornik, 2021 for Brazil), collateral laws (e.g., Vig, 2013), or financial liberalization (e.g., Crescenzi and\nLimodio (2021), Bau and Matray (2023) and references therein).\n8income inequality (which includes capital income) and derives ambiguous predictions. The\neffect of financial development depends on whether that development is concentrated on the\nintensive or the extensive margin (e.g., Greenwood and Jovanovic, 1990, Townsend and Ueda,\n2006; Greenwood, Sanchez, and Wang, 2010), how it alters the aggregate demand of workers\nand investment returns (e.g., Gin\u00b4 e and Townsend, 2004; Buera, Kaboski, and Shin, 2021), and\nwhether individuals can accumulate human capital (e.g., Mestieri, Schauer, and Townsend,\n2017). These models generally conclude that capital income pushes inequality upward, as it\nmostly benefits the wealthy and entrepreneurs, while rising wages push inequality downward\n(e.g., Buera, Kaboski, and Shin, 2021; Ji, Teng, and Townsend, 2023). These theoretical and\nquantitative results that wage inequality should go down as financial development increases\nrely on the assumption that labor is a homogeneous input to production. Therefore, higher\nlabor demand in more-productive sectors will benefit more lower-paid workers who reallocate\naway from less-productive sectors.\nOur contribution to this literature is twofold. First, we provide rare empirical evidence on\nthe effect of financial inclusion on wage inequality, as empirical evidence focuses on developed\ncountries and studies credit rather than financial inclusion.9Second, we show that financial\ninclusion leads to higher wage inequality in our setting due to skill differentials. Therefore, we\nshow that taking into account labor heterogeneity and limits to human capital accumulation\nin macro-development models is crucial to better understanding and predicting how policies\npromoting financial development will affect inequality.\nFourth, this paper contributes to our understanding of how financial frictions impact\ncapital and entrepreneurial talent misallocation and thereby economic development.10More\nbroadly, we relate to the literature studying how financial frictions affect firm labor demand\nand employment outcomes.11We contribute to the specific subset of the literature that\nstudies how financial frictions affect the demand for skilled workers and the skill premium in\ndeveloping countries (Fonseca and Doornik, 2021).12\nFinally, because the reform we explore relies on the expansion of government-owned banks,\nwe relate to the broad literature studying the economic effects of government ownership of\n9.

Most of this literature emphasizes the risk of political capture and\nthe creation of politically motivated credit cycles. We show that such forms of ownership can\nhave positive effects on economic development when the private sector is unable or unwilling\nto serve underprivileged areas, even in countries where corruption can be high.\n2 Institutional background and data\n2.1 The Brazilian banking landscape\n2.1.1 Situation pre-reform\nBrazil has three types of public banks: government-owned banks controlled by the federal\ngovernment (Banco do Brazil, Caixa Economica Federal, Banco do Nordeste, and Banco\nda Amazonia), government-owned banks controlled by state governments, and a national\ndevelopment bank (BNDES).\nGovernment-owned banks, in particular the ones controlled by the federal government,\ndiffer from most public banks in developing countries and are better described as \u201cgovernment-\nowned commercial banks.\u201d They are profitable and their performance is comparable to that\nof both foreign and domestic private banks (Mettenheim, 2010).\nBNDES, the national development bank, differs substantially from federal and state-owned\nbanks and is much closer to public banks in other developing countries that have been studied\npreviously such as India (e.g., Burgess and Pande, 2005). This bank provides subsidized loans\nto targeted sectors or even \u201cgrants,\u201d in the form of loans that are often not reimbursed. Two\nthings are important to highlight about BNDES. First, this is the only bank studied by\nprevious papers that have documented the existence of political influence in banks\u2019 behavior\nin Brazil (e.g., Carvalho, 2014). Second, this bank, as well as state-controlled banks, was not\npart of the policy and not involved in the branch expansion we study, and its lending was not\nspecifically targeted at treated or control cities. Therefore, in the rest of the paper, we use\nthe term \u201cpublic banks\u201d to refer to federally-owned banks, which excludes BNDES.\nPublic banks differ from private banks in some dimensions, such as in having a legal\nmandate to provide earmarked credit.13However in practice, public banks are similar to\nprivate banks in their lending practices and the sectors to which they lend. For instance, public\nand private banks have similar portfolio compositions across credit products and borrowers,\ncharge similar interest rates and face similar delinquency rates (Coelho, Mello, and Rezende,\n13. There are also incentives for private banks to provide earmarked credit and, in fact, nearly 40% of\noutstanding indirect earmarked loans to firms in 2016 were originated by private banks (Ornelas, Pedraza,\nRuiz-Ortega, and Silva, 2021).\n102013). These banks are also similar along standard balance sheet and income statement\nmeasures. As we show in Figure 2, there are no significant differences between branches of\npublic and private banks across a wide range of covariates, including measures of lending,\nprofitability, loan performance, and size.\n2.1.2 The Banks for All program\nBanks for All (Banco para Todos ) was a federal government program announced in 2004\nas part of the government\u2019s 2004\u20132007 multi-year plan ( Plano Plurianual ). The program\nwas under the purview of the Finance Ministry ( Minist\u00b4 erio da Fazenda ) and aimed to pro-\nvide Brazil\u2019s unbanked population with access to financial services and products through the\nactions of federal government banks, particularly Caixa Ec\u02c6 onomica Federal and Banco do\nBrasil.\nTo achieve the goal of reaching underserved communities, the federal government promoted\nthe physical presence of public banks throughout the country, focusing on cities with no\npresence of government banks. Figure 1plots the evolution of municipalities without a public\nbank branch since 2000 (the dashed red line). Consistent with the effect of the reform, this\nshare is stable until 2004 at 60%, then drops abruptly in 2005 and keeps declining such that\nin 2014, only 44% of municipalities have no government-owned banks. Figure 1also reports\nthe share of municipalities without any bank branch (the solid blue line), and shows that\nthe expansion of public banks resulted in a drop in the share of cities without any bank\nbranches.14\nThe program succeeded in reaching unbanked cities and underbanked populations. Ac-\ncording to an evaluation of the program by the federal government, public banks opened\n7.8 million accounts and banked 1.46 million low-income, previously unbanked individuals\nbetween 2004\u20132007 (Minist\u00b4 erio da Fazenda, 2007).15In Section 4, we formally show that\ncities without public bank branches prior to 2004 saw a sharp increase in credit and deposits\nfollowing the introduction of the program.\nBanking correspondents. In order to reach unbanked households, the program also relied\non correspondent banking outlets. These arrangements consist of banks hiring commercial\nentities\u2014typically lottery retailers, post offices, pharmacies, and other retailers\u2014to serve\nas distribution outlets for financial services. Since 2003, financial services offered by corre-\nspondents include the opening of accounts, deposits and withdrawals, payments, and loan\n14. Between 2004 and 2014 (the end of our sample period), 1,262 new bank branches were open in cities\neligible to the reform.\n15. For comparison, in 2007, there were approximately 16 million individuals residing in the cities that\ncompose our treatment group.\n11Figure 1: Share of Municipalities without Bank Branches\n0.350.400.450.500.550.60\n2000 2005 2010 2015\nNo Public Bank No Bank\nThis figure plots the evolution of the share of municipalities without at least one government-owned bank branch in red and the\nshare of municipalities without any bank branches in blue.\napplications.16The number of correspondents went from approximately 20,000 in 2000 to\nover 150,000 in 2010 (Loureiro, Abreu Madeira, and Bader, 2016) and, taking into account\npartnerships with correspondents, government-owned banks were present in 100% of munici-\npalities by 2007 (Minist\u00b4 erio da Fazenda, 2007).\nWhile we do not observe the precise location of correspondents, we know that, prior\nto the reform, they were concentrated in areas already served by bank branches (Loureiro,\nAbreu Madeira, and Bader, 2016). One notable network of correspondents was that of Banco\nPostal, which emerged from a 2001 partnership between Bradesco and the Brazilian Post\nand Telegraph Company to provide financial services at post offices. However, despite its\ngoal of reaching all unbanked municipalities, it was only present in roughly half of unbanked\nmunicipalities prior to the reform (Gual and Ans\u00b4 on, 2008). Moreover, prior to 2003, corre-\nspondents were not allowed to provide most of the services they offer today. Thus, to the\nextent that they were available, they mostly provided bill payment services and were not a\nmeaningful substitute for financial institutions and were particularly ill-suited for the needs\nof firms (Bittencourt, Magalh\u02dc aes, and Abramovay, 2005). Even after 2003, the vast majority\nof Brazilian households and an even larger fraction of Brazilian businesses did not use corre-\nspondent banking outlets for deposits, withdrawals, account openings, or borrowing, and did\nnot view correspondents as safe or trustworthy according to survey evidence (Sanford, 2013).\n16. CMN Resolution 3,110 of July 31, 2003.\n12Figure 2: Public vs. Private Bank Covariate Balance\nLoans\nDeposits\nPro\ufb01ts\nROA\nNon-Performing Loans\nLoss Provisions\nTotal Assets\nLiquid Assets\nTotal Liabilities\n-.15 -.1 -.05 0 .05 .1 .15\nThis figure shows coefficient estimates and 95% error bands of the difference between public and private banks along different\nvariables, using ESTBAN data at the branch-year level between 2000 and 2004. All variables are normalized to have a mean of\nzero and a standard deviation of one. Standard errors are clustered at the bank level.\nTaken together, these findings suggest that banking correspondents were present in many\nunbanked municipalities prior to the reform but mostly provided bill payment services. While\nhaving some access to financial services is certainly better than no access at all, the fact that\nthese services were limited implies that the expansion of branch networks we study led to\nfinancial inclusion by improving the quality and scope of financial products and services to\nwhich households and businesses have access.\n2.2 Data\nWe use data from four distinct sources. Matched employer-employee data come from the\nRela\u00b8 c\u02dc ao Anual de Informa\u00b8 c\u02dc oes (RAIS), a mandatory annual survey containing information\non the universe of tax-registered firms in Brazil. There are severe penalties associated with\nincomplete or late information, which leads to a high degree of compliance and essentially\ncomplete coverage of all employees in the formal sector. RAIS contains time-invariant identi-\nfiers for workers and firms, as well as information on where the firm is located. We also observe\ndata on workers average gross monthly earnings, occupation and several socio-demographic\ncharacteristics such as their education, race, age, and gender.\n13Using geographical information on firms, we build a city-level panel from 2000 to 2014\nwith information on average wages, wage inequality, employment, and skill-specific wages.\nBecause municipality borders have changed over time, we use as our level of aggregation\nminimum comparable areas ( \u00b4Area M\u00b4 \u0131nima Compar\u00b4 avel , or AMC), which can be consistently\ntracked throughout our sample period. This reduces the number of cities from over 5,000 to\n4,260. In the rest of the text, we use the term \u201ccity\u201d to refer to an AMC.\nThe number of bank branches, lending activity, and deposits come from the ESTBAN\ndatabase maintained by the Central Bank of Brazil. The data provides branch-level balance\nsheet information that we aggregate to the city level, which allows us to decompose the number\nof branches, credit, and deposits between public and private banks. Note that these data do\nnot include correspondent banking outlets (such as the outlets of Banco Postal), which means\nthat we do not observe the full impact of the program on financial inclusion. We discuss this\npoint further in Section 4.\nFinally, we use city-level aggregate data. We obtain time-varying outcomes from the\nBrazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics ( Instituto Brasileiro de Geografia e Estat\u00b4 \u0131stica ,\nor IBGE), and cross-sectional demographic and economic characteristics in 2000 from the\nCensus, such as population distribution across years of schooling and share of workers in\ninformality.\n3 Empirical strategy\nThe reform promoted financial inclusion by targeting cities with no government-owned banks,\nso we identify treated cities as those that did not have a public bank prior to 2004. This implies\nthat all control cities had a public bank prior to the reform.17We can identify the effect of\nthe financial inclusion reform by comparing the evolution of multiple economic outcomes for\ntreated and control cities, before and after the reform, in a difference-in-differences setting.\nThe key identifying assumption is that absent the reform, treated and control cities would\nhave evolved in close parallel. While this identification strategy does not require that treated\nand control cities be similar in levels prior to the reform, any such similarity makes the\ncommon-trend assumption more plausible.\nThis strategy raises a natural challenge: the average treated city in Brazil does not look\nlike the average untreated city. Since the reform targeted unbanked cities, these tended to\nbe smaller and less developed, and it is possible that they evolved and grew in different ways\nafter the reform relative to other untreated cities for reasons not directly tied to the reform.\nFor instance, they could have disproportionally benefited from the period of sustained growth,\n17. Cities with no public bank prior to 2004 represents 43% of Brazilian cities.\n14partially fueled by a commodity boom, that Brazil entered into during our sample period.\nFigure 3 plots a covariate balance test and shows that the unconditional difference in levels\nbetween treated and untreated cities (green coefficients) is large and significant for most city\ncharacteristics.\nIn order to address this challenge and to strengthen our empirical strategy, we use a parsi-\nmonious matching approach to construct a control group of untreated cities that is observably\nsimilar to treated cities on a wide set of characteristics.\nMatching. Our matching strategy first targets city size. We start with all 4,260 cities and\ncompute quintiles of population. We then match each treated city with all control cities in\nthe same population quintile with replacement.18. This parsimonious approach addresses a\nlarge part of the heterogeneity. The red dots in Figure 3show that the treatment and control\ngroups are now similar over a rich array of city characteristics constructed pre-reform that\nwere not targeted in the matching process. These characteristics include proxies for economic\ndevelopment (GDP, employment, skilled employment, size of informal sector); propensity\nto receive social transfers (local government expenditures, political affiliation of the mayor);\neconomic integration (distance to the state capital, share of population born elsewhere, exports\nand imports made by local firms); exposure to aggregate shocks and the commodity sector\n(local GDP co-movement with aggregate GDP, total employment in commodities, exposure\nto commodity prices post-reform); and development of the private banking sector (private\nloans and private deposits). In addition, while some of the point estimates are not exactly\nzero, the standardized difference between both groups remains well below the threshold of\n0.20 suggested by Imbens and Rubin (2015).\nAfter matching on population quintile, the only remaining large and statistically significant\ndifference between treated and control cities is the change in the Gini index during the pre-\nperiod. Since we are interested in understanding how financial development affects inequality,\nand because Brazil experienced large changes in inequality during this period (e.g., Lopez and\nPerry, 2008) we also match on changes in inequality pre-reform. We do so by selecting the\nthree control cities in the same population quintile with the closest pre-reform Gini growth.\nThe blue dots in Figure 3show differences between treated and control cities after we further\nrestrict our matches to this criterion. The difference in Gini growth becomes much closer to\nthe 0.2 threshold and later in the paper, we show that the Gini index of treatment and control\nunits evolved in close parallel prior to the reform, and that there is no evidence of pre-trends\n(Figure 8).\nAfter our baseline matching procedure, we are left with 1,415 treated cities and a total of\n18. Because the same city can be used multiple times as a control, we follow Chaisemartin and Ramirez-\nCuellar (2021) and adjust the standard errors by clustering at the matching pair level\n15Figure 3: Balance Covariate\nPopulation\nLocal GDP\nGDP-comovement\nPrivate Loans\nPrivate Deposits\nGovernment Expenditures\nEmployment\nEmployment Skilled\nEmployment Commodities\nCommodity Exposure\nSize Informal Sector\nWorkers Party\nTrade\nPopulation Born Elsewhere\nDistance to State Capital\n\u0394Gini\n-1 -.5 0 .5 1\nUnconditional Population Population + Gini\nThis figure shows coefficient estimates and 95% error bands of the difference between treated and control cities along different\nvariables.

We report the summary statistics of our final sample in Table 1, and we\ndisplay the spatial distribution of treated and control cities in Figure 4. Treated and control\ncities are spread out across Brazil and do not show geographical clustering.\nEconometric specification: city level. We analyze the effect of an increase in bank\ncoverage on economic development and inequality by estimating a series of matched difference-\nin-differences (D-i-D) specifications of the form:\nYc,g,t=\u03b2 Treated c\u00d7Post t\u22652004 +Xc,t+\u03b8c+\u03b4g,t+\u03b5g,c,t (1)\nwhere Yc,g,tare various city outcomes for city cat year tthat belongs to a matched treated-\ncontrol group g, and Treated cis a dummy variable that takes the value one if city chad no\ngovernment-owned banks prior to 2004. \u03b8care city fixed effects that remove time-invariant\nheterogeneity across cities, and \u03b4g,tare matched group-by-year fixed effects that controls for\ntime-varying unobserved heterogeneity across groups. Because we select our groups using pre-\nreform population size and inequality growth, the inclusion of matched group-by-year fixed\neffect implies that we are absorbing unobserved correlated shocks that might exist between\n16Table 1: Summary Statistics\nMean\nMed.

Similarly, unobserved shocks\nto places with larger changes in their Gini prior to 2004 will also be differenced out by\nthese fixed effects. Xc,tis a collection of city-level controls that we include in the robustness\nanalysis.19We cluster our standard errors at the matching-pair level to account for serial\ncorrelation and weight the regression by population size at the beginning of the period to\nestimate the aggregate effect of the reform on inequality and economic development.\nIntent-to-treat estimator. Because our identification strategy assumes that all cities with-\nout a public bank branch are treated immediately after 2004, our estimator can be interpreted\nas an intent-to-treat, where the eligibility rule is whether a city has a public bank branch and\nthe treatment year is 2004. We choose this approach rather than using the actual date when\n19. We use the value pre-reform and interact with year fixed effects to avoid the classic problem of \u201cbad\ncontrols.\u201d\n17Figure 4: Geographical Distribution of Treated and Control Cities\nThis figure shows the geographical distribution of treated and control cities. \u201cNot in sample\u201d refers to cities that are neither\ntreated nor part of the matched control group, and thus not in our final sample.\na public bank branch opens because the latter would imply defining treated and control units\nbased on the ex-post realization of the policy, rather than an ex-ante assignment rule. Doing\nso will bias the estimator if the opening of a bank branch after the policy is not random\nor accidental, but instead the result of systematic differences in behavior or characteristics\namong cities eligible to the reform.20\nIn this case, it is possible to recover an unbiased estimate of the treatment by ignoring\nthe actual receipt of the treatment and focusing on the causal effect of assignment to the\ntreatment, in an intention-to-treat analysis (Fisher et al., 1990; Imbens and Rubin, 2015).\nIn our setting, we can assume that the policy (the assignment) is exogenous based on the\nex-ante characteristic of not having a government bank prior to 2004. But whether or not a\ngovernment bank branch opens in these a priori treated cities after the policy is adopted (i.e.,\nwhether the assigned unit takes the treatment) is potentially endogenous to their economic\noutcomes.21\n20. This is because the exogeneity of the assignment does not bear on the exogeneity of the receipt of\ntreatment if the receipt of treatment is different from the assignment to treatment (e.g., Athey and Imbens,\n2017).\n21. To be able to use a staggered treatment, there would have to exist an official staggered assignment rule\nbut none of the official program documentation we examined suggests this was the case. Therefore, the only\nunbiased estimator we can implement requires us to consider as treated all cities that were eligible to receive\na public bank branch after 2004, in an intent-to-treat analysis.\n18Identifying assumptions and potential threats to identification. Our identification\nstrategy faces two main threats: (i) Even if treated and control cities are perfectly similar\nex-ante, unobserved ex-post shocks might specifically affect the cities that are treated by our\nfinancial inclusion policy. (ii) Despite the use of a matching procedure, the variable we use\nto sort cities into treatment and control groups\u2014the presence of a government-controlled\nbank\u2014might still be correlated with other city-level characteristics that make treated units\nmore sensitive to aggregate shocks post 2004. We discuss how we address both of these\nconcerns below.\n(i) Treated-specific ex-post shocks. Even with perfect ex-ante covariate balance between\ntreated and control cities, the estimated effect of promoting financial inclusion on city-level\noutcomes could be biased if this policy correlates with other unobserved shocks that specifi-\ncally affect cities that received the treatment. This is a concern in a setting where no city has\na bank and identification is achieved by bank entry in some cities and not others. However, it\nis important to emphasize that our setting is conceptually different. By construction, public\nbanks are present in all control cities prior to the reform. Therefore, any bank-specific shock\nafter 2004 will affect both treated and control cities.\nThis setting therefore directly addresses two standard concerns about empirical designs\nfeaturing bank entry. First, if public banks experience idiosyncratic shocks that affect their\ncredit supply after 2004 (either due to shocks to their cost of funding or because they face\npolitical pressure to extend credit), both treated and control cities will benefit from a credit\nexpansion, and our coefficient of interest will not be biased.22\nSecond, potential correlations between financial inclusion policies and the expansion of\nother social welfare programs after 2004 are also addressed due to a specificity of the Brazil-\nian institutional context. Most of the large-scale welfare programs, and in particular Bolsa\nFam\u00b4 \u0131lia, are distributed via public banks. Therefore, all cities (including cities in the control\ngroup) would benefit from the creation or expansion of such programs. We also conduct more\ndetailed tests about this specific concern in Section 7.2and find no evidence that it biases\nour results.\n(ii) Covariate balance and ex-ante differences. The second main concern is that ex-ante\ndifferences lead treated cities to respond differentially to aggregate shocks.\nWe address this problem in four ways. First, as we show in Figure 3, using a parsimo-\nnious matching estimator allows us to obtain covariate balance across a wide range of proxies\nfor exposure to commodity-driven aggregate growth, economic integration of the city, and\n22. To be precise, the coefficient is not biased under the assumption that this bank-specific shock affects\nall branches of the bank in the same way. This would not be the case if this bank shock affects the bank\u2019s\nbranches differentially, for instance, due to age differences across branches.\n19exposure to welfare programs promoted by left-leaning governments. Second, we show that\ntreated and control cities were on a similar trend before the reform for a host of outcomes\n(credit, employment, number of firms, inequalities) in Sections 4,5, and 6. The parallel-trends\npre-reform indicate that any remaining unobserved differences that could drive the estimated\neffects would need to have not mattered before 2004 and only mattered afterward.\nThird, we directly control for a collection of additional city-level characteristics. We show\nin Appendix Tables A4andA5that point estimates are very stable to the inclusion of controls\nsuch as GDP per capita, employment in the commodity sector, skilled employment, political\naffiliation of the mayor, trade, distance to the state capital, and the co-movement of local GDP\nwith aggregate fluctuations, as well as to all the different combinations of such controls.23\nFinally, we exploit the granularity of our data and adapt equation (1) into a D-i-D estima-\ntor at the city-by-industry level, which allows us to relax the assumptions needed to identify\nthe effect of the reform. Because we can now include industry-by-year fixed effects and there-\nfore non-parametrically control for time-varying unobserved industry shocks, the effect of the\nreform remains unbiased even if treated and control cities are unbalanced in their exposure\nto sector-specific shocks (for instance because treated cities have more employment in the\ncommodity sector).\nSpecifically, we estimate the regression:\nYi,c,g,t=\u03b2 Treated c\u00d7Post t\u22652004 +Xi,c,t+\u03b3i,c+\u03b4i,g,t+\u03b5g,c,t (2)\nThe key difference in equation (2) relative to our city-level D-i-D is that we can include\n\u03b4i,g,t, i.e., matched group-by-industry-year fixed effects. These fixed effects mean that \u03b2is\nestimated by comparing the same industry across treated and control cities that belong to the\nsame matched group. This implies in particular, that sector-specific level shocks post 2004,\nsuch as commodity booms or productivity shocks specific to certain sectors, cannot bias the\nestimation of \u03b2. We report the results and details of the estimation in Section 7.1.\n4 Effect on financial inclusion\nIn this section, we start by describing how the policy affected financial inclusion by fostering\nbank entry and increased deposits and lending in similar proportion. We then discuss the\npossible frictions that can explain the patterns we observe in the data and how the reform\n23. Given that the reform may have a direct impact on many city characteristics, using time-varying controls\nwould potentially bias our coefficients of interest. This is commonly referred to as the problem of \u201cbad controls\u201d\n(e.g., Angrist and Pischke, 2008). We address this problem by using the pre-reform value of these controls\ninteracted with year fixed effects.\n20could affect real outcomes.\n4.1 Higher access to bank branches\nWe start by showing that the reform increased access to bank branches, as the entry of\ngovernment-owned banks did not crowd out private banks. To do so, we use as the LHS\nvariable in equation (1) a dummy that equals one if the city has any bank branch (private of\npublic), which allows us to estimate the change in likelihood for treated cities to have access\nto a bank branch.\nWe also decompose this dummy between a dummy that equals one if the city has a public\nbank branch, and a dummy that equals one if the city has a private bank branch. Figure 5\nreports the event study coefficients of our difference-in-differences estimation. Panel (a) shows\nresults when the LHS is a dummy that equals one if the city has any bank branch (public\nor private), while panel (b) decomposes the change in likelihood to have a bank branch (the\ngrey circles) into the change coming from access to a public bank (the blue diamonds) and\naccess to a private bank (the green triangles).\nFigure 5: Effect of the Program on Having a Bank Branch\n-.10.1.2.3.4.5.6.7 \n2000 2002 2004 2006 2008 2010 2012 2014\nYear\n(a) Any Branch\nTotalPublic\nPrivate\n-.10.1.2.3.4.5.6.7 \n2000 2002 2004 2006 2008 2010 2012 2014\nYear (b) Public vs. Private Banks\nThis figure plots the yearly coefficients and 95% confidence intervals of the difference-in-differences estimator in equation (1) of\nthe 2004 bank reform. Dependent variables are dummies that equal one if the city has at least a branch of any bank, a public\nbank, or a private bank, respectively. Standard errors are clustered at the matching-pair level.\nTwo facts are noteworthy. First, the probability of having a branch from a private bank\nin treated and control cities evolve in close parallel prior to the reform. This result indicates\nthat private banks in treated and control cities evolved in the same way during the large\ncredit boom that Brazil experienced prior to the reform, and remain on similar trends even\nafter the reform.\n21Second, the expansion of public banks only modestly crowds out private banks, resulting\nin a large increase in overall financial development for treated cities. The probability of\nhaving a public bank branch or any bank branch increases sharply after 2004, in line with the\naggregate pattern reported in Figure 1, and it continues to increase progressively throughout\nthe period with no mean reversion post reform.\n4.2 Increased deposits and credit\nWe then study how this higher presence of bank branches affects deposits and credit supply.\nIn order to measure financial development net of any mechanical wealth effects, we compute\ntotal credit and total deposits scaled by city GDP. Because treated cities often have zero credit\nand deposits before the reform (since many have no bank branch) and, by construction, have\nzero credit and deposits from government-owned banks, we estimate the effect of the policy\nusing the inverse hyperbolic sine transformation of the log function.24\nWe show the event study coefficients of our difference-in-differences estimation for total\ndeposits and total credit in Figure A1. The event studies show that credit and deposits for\ntreated and control units evolve in close parallel prior to the reform and that the expansion in\ncredit and deposits is entirely driven by public banks, with minimal crowding out of private\nbanks. Panel (a) of Figure A1shows that the initial increase in credit after the reform\ncontinues throughout the period and is driven entirely by public credit. There is a modest\ndecline in private credit after 2010, but the total amount of credit still rises substantially after\nthe reform, implying that overall, treated cities benefit from an increase in credit. Panel (b)\nof Figure A1reports analogous results for deposits, and shows that deposits increase sharply\nin 2005 and continue to rise throughout the post-reform period.\nWe also conduct robustness checks by using the level of credit and deposits for branches\nthat open in both treated and control cities after the reform and we find similar post-reform\ndynamics, in particular a similar increase in deposits and credit (Appendix Figure A2).25\nWe report pooled estimates in Table 2and confirm the results of Figure A1. For all\nvariables, the reform has a strong and significant effect on financial inclusion, driven by\ngovernment-owned banks. The probability of having a bank branch increases by 18.6 p.p.\n(column 1), which fosters the accumulation of total deposits and total credit at the city level\n(columns 4 and 7).\n24. The inverse hyperbolic sine transformation of the log function is defined as log[X+ (X2+ 1)1/2]. Except\nfor very small values of X, the inverse sine is approximately equal to log(2X) orlog(2) + log(X), and so it\ncan be interpreted in exactly the same way as a standard logarithmic dependent variable. But unlike a log\nvariable, the inverse hyperbolic sine is defined at zero and is less sensitive to jumps around zero than the more\nwidely used log(X+ 1) transformation.\n25. By definition, these variables equal zero for both treated and control units prior to the reform. This\nmeans that, unlike Figure A1, this exercise should not be interpreted as a test of the parallel trends assumption.\n22Table 2: Effect of the Program on Bank Branches, Credit, and Deposits\nDep\nendent Variable: Has Bank Branch Deposits Credit\nAll\nPublic Private All Public Private All Public Private\n(1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) (9)\nT\nreated\u00d7Post 0.186*** 0.425*** -0.022** 0.880*** 1.295*** -0.098*** 0.935*** 1.557*** -0.154***\n(0.016) (0.017) (0.009) (0.070) (0.074) (0.037) (0.072) (0.071) (0.036)\nCit\ny FE \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713\nMatch\u00d7Year FE \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713\nObservations 79,995 79,995 79,995 79,995 79,995 79,995 79,995 79,995 79,995\nThis table shows the effect of the reform on financial development outcomes at the city level using the difference-in-differences\nestimator in equation (1).

Standard errors are clustered at the matching-pair level. ***, **, * indicate statistical\nsignificance at the 1%, 5%, and 10% levels.\nThese results confirm the idea that financial inclusion policies can be successful at starting\na virtuous circle between savings and credit, since the average expansion of credit in a city\nmatches the average increase in deposits flowing into the branches of the same city. This\nsimilar increase in credit and deposits implies that bank branches in treated cities are able to\nincrease their credit supply without having to use capital coming from other cities and that\ntreated cities are not net capital receivers, but instead are able to engage in a self-sustained\nexpansion of credit and deposits.26\n5 Effect on economic development\n5.1 Average effect\nWe start by estimating the effect of the reform on aggregate outcomes at the city level. Stan-\ndard models of macro-finance development emphasize that financial frictions hamper economic\ndevelopment because talented but poor individuals are unable to start a firm (misallocation\nof talent) and existing productive but cash-poor firms are unable to expand their business\n(misallocation of capital). As financial development progresses, more firms are created and\nexisting firms grow, generating higher demand for labor that translates into higher wages.\nWe test how the financial inclusion policy affects the different elements of this causal chain\nby estimating equation (1) with the total number of firms, total employment, employment\ngrowth at small firms (less than 20 employees), large firms, average wage and the number of\n26. While the SUTVA assumption is, by definition, untestable, we also show in Appendix Figure A3the\nevolution of total credit separately for treated and control cities. While the growth of credit in treated cities\naccelerates after 2004, it does not appear to be at the expense of a slowing down of credit in control cities.\n23industries as outcomes. Table 3 reports the results of these different regressions. In column\n1, we show that the number of firms increases by 9.8% and that total employment increases\nby 10%. This increase is concentrated at small firms (less than twenty employees), which\nexpands twice as fast as large firms (column 3 vs. 4). This increase in the demand for labor\nexplains why average wage increases by 4.1%.\nIn column 6, we study how the reform affected industry dynamics. Consistent with mod-\nels emphasizing that economic development requires countries to diversify their industrial\nbase and explore their comparative advantage (e.g., Hausmann and Rodrik, 2003; Imbs and\nWacziarg, 2003), we find that financial development increases the number of industries, which\nwe measure as the number of distinct 4-digit industries (column 6).27\nTable 3: Effect of the Reform on Economic Development\nDep\nendent variable # Firms Employment Employment Employment Average # Industries\nall small firms large firms wage\n(1)\n(2) (3) (4) (5) (6)\nT\nreated\u00d7Post 0.098*** 0.100*** 0.214*** 0.116*** 0.041*** 0.088***\n(0.011) (0.015) (0.023) (0.018) (0.005) (0.008)\nCit\ny FE \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713\nMatch\u00d7Year FE \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713\nObservations 79,995 79,995 79,947 79,995 79,995 79,995\nThis table shows the effect of the reform on economic development at the city level using the difference-in-differences estimator\nin equation (1). All variables in columns 1\u20136 are in logs. In columns 3 and 4, employment is decomposed between firms with\nless than 20 employees (\u201csmall firms\u201d) and more than 20 employees (\u201clarge firms\u201d). The number of industries (column 6) is the\nnumber of distinct 4-digit industries in the city-year. Standard errors are clustered at the matching-pair level. ***, **, * indicate\nstatistical significance at the 1%, 5%, and 10% levels, respectively.\nWe reproduce this analysis in graphical form by estimating the event study version of\nequation (1) in Figure 6. In all cases, we find that treated cities display no pre-trend relative\nto control cities. We also find that each outcome increases progressively over time after the\nreform and stabilizes at a new high after five years, consistent with the notion that the reform\nrelaxed financial constraints and allowed the local economy to reach a new steady state with\na higher level of development.\nDiscussion of magnitudes. While we show in Section 4 that the reform led to financial\ndevelopment, we do not observe the entire effect of the reform and therefore cannot use these\nresults as a \u201cfirst stage.\u201d In particular, alltreated cities that did not experience the entry\nof a bank branch after the reform obtained at least a banking correspondent (Minist\u00b4 erio da\n27.

Standard errors are clustered at the matching-pair level.\nFazenda, 2007), but we unfortunately cannot observe it in the data.28And while the evidence\npresented in Section 2.1 indicates that correspondents do not provide the quality and scope\nof financial services as bank branches, having a correspondent almost certainly provides more\naccess than having neither a correspondent nor a branch, suggesting that all cities receive some\nlevel of treatment. Therefore, our estimates on financial outcomes under-estimate the true\nimpact of the reform on financial development, and rescaling the coefficients on the economic\ndevelopment outcomes shown in Table 3 by the point estimates in Table 2\u2014as in a standard\n2SLS approach\u2014would inflate the true magnitude of the elasticities.\nDue to this caveat, we think the more natural approach is to directly interpret the point\n28. As explained in Section 2.2, data on bank branches does not keep track of banking correspondents.\n25estimates in Table 3 as the elasticity of economic development outcomes with respect to the\nintroduction of formal financial services. In this context, the two closest experiments to our\nsetting are Barboni, Field, and Pande (2021), which looks at the entry of bank branches in\nIndian villages, and Bruhn and Love (2014), which looks at the opening of bank branches in\nstores of a large retailer of consumer goods focused on underserved and low-income clients.\nBarboni, Field, and Pande (2021) finds that a new bank branch leads to an 8% reduction\nin poverty and a 6% increase in average income. The latter is comparable to the 4.1%\nincrease in average wages that we estimate in our setting. Bruhn and Love (2014) finds similar\nestimates, with income increasing by 7%, employment by 1.4%, and informal businesses by\n7.6%, although formal business is unaffected. Our larger effects on employment and business\ncreation can be explained by the fact that our experiment improved financial development\nat the city level, and therefore is more likely to have positive \u201clocal GE effects.\u201d The longer\ntime period over which we can trace out the effect of the reform can also partly explain the\ndifference since resources reallocate slowly, particularly in developing countries (e.g., Buera\nand Shin, 2013). These slow-moving changes underscore the importance of measuring and\ntaking into account transitional dynamics when estimating the effect of reforms on economic\ndevelopment.\n5.2 Mechanisms\nThere are two main channels through which financial development promotes economic growth\nin this setting. First, bank expansion can foster local demand either because it relaxes indi-\nviduals\u2019 borrowing constraints and reduces their need for precautionary savings, or because\nthe opening of a bank branch functioned as fiscal stimulus.29\nSecond, bank expansion can foster supply by reducing investment frictions, thereby boost-\ning investment of existing firms and facilitating the entry of new firms. In this case, the\ndifferential dependence on local demand should not matter and we expect both tradable and\nnon-tradable industries to benefit from the reform.\n5.2.1 Consumption vs. business development channel\nTo test if most of the effect is coming from a bank-expansion-induced increase in demand,\nwe decompose growth in aggregate employment at the city level by firms in non-tradable\nvs. tradable industries. Indeed, since non-tradable industries are more dependent on local\ndemand than tradable industries\u2014because, by definition, tradable industries produce goods\n29. Financial inclusion will reduce the need of precautionary savings for instance because of limited insurance\nin developing countries.\n26that can be sold across the whole country, if not worldwide\u2014an increase in local demand\ndriven by the reform should benefit non-tradable industries relatively more.\nTo do so, we estimate equation (2) and split the regression between tradable and non-\ntradable, which requires us to work at the city-industry level. This requires a slight modifi-\ncation to our specification since the reform had an impact on the entry and exit of industries\nat the city level (Table 3\u2013column 6), implying that the baseline specification of equation (1)\nat the city-by-industry level will not match the aggregate results at the city level.\nWe explain in detail how we account for this adjustment in Section 7.1. Briefly, we create\na balanced panel and compute the mid-point growth rate between the average pre period\n(before to 2004) and post period (after 2004). We show in Table 11that this specification\npreserves the aggregate city level results and report that, for all variables, it produces very\nsimilar point estimates as the ones obtained with our baseline log panel specification.\nTable 4: Employment in Tradables and Non-Tradables\nDependent variable Employment\nTradable Definition Manufacturing Value of Traded Goods Geographic Concentration\nTradable Yes No Yes No Yes No\n(1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6)\nTreated\u00d7Post 0.200*** 0.123*** 0.190*** 0.124*** 0.146*** 0.126***\n(0.037) (0.015) (0.042) (0.015) (0.025) (0.015)\nMatch\u00d7Industry\u00d7Year FE \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713\nObservations 106,574 414,795 84,772 436,597 129,728 391,641\nThis table reports the effect of the policy on employment at the city-by-(4-digit) industry level. Data are collapsed as an\naverage \u201cpre\u201d ( t\u22642004) and the average \u201cpost\u201d (t > 2004) periods, and each dependent variables are the midpoint growth rate\ngX\nj,c= [(Xj,c,t+Xj,c,t\u22121 )\u00d70.5]. Each cell is weighted by gX\nj,c/(P\nj\u2208cgX\nj,c)\u00d7pop2000. See Section 7.1for a detailed explanation\nof the construction. In columns 1\u20132, tradable is defined as firms in the manufacturing sector. In columns 3\u20134, we define tradable\nindustries based on the value of exports and imports in the custom data aggregated at the sector level. In columns 5\u20136, tradable\nis defined using the geographical HHI of employment of each industry. \u201cTradable\u201d (column 5) corresponds to an HHI in the top\nquartile (i.e., high level of geographic concentration). Standard errors are clustered at the matching-pair level. ***, **, * indicate\nstatistical significance at the 1%, 5%, and 10% levels, respectively.\nWe use three methods to identify industries that produce tradable goods and are therefore\nnot dependent on local demand. First, we classify an industry as tradable if it is in the\nmanufacturing sector, and non-tradable otherwise. Second, we flag industries as tradable if\nthe imports plus exports equal to at least $10,000 per worker, or if total exports plus imports\nfor the industry four-digit industry exceeds $500M.30Third, we compute the geographical\ndispersion (HHI) of employment at the industry level and classify tradable industries as those\nin the top quartile of the HHI distribution. The intuition behind this proposed measure is that,\n30. Numbers are in 2006 values. We manually build a crosswalk between US NAICS codes and the Brazilian\nindustry classification.\n27since non-tradable industries have to be consumed locally, they should be less geographically\nconcentrated.\nWe report the results of the effect of the reform on tradable and non-tradable industries\nin Table 4. We find that employment growth is almost two times bigger in tradable industries\ndepending on the exact definition (e.g., column 1 vs. 2). This implies that while the entry\nof bank branches in the cities might have had a direct effect on demand, a substantial part\nof the increase in economic development induced by the financial inclusion policy is coming\nfrom a relaxation of financing constraints for entrepreneurs.\nThe fact that firms in tradable industries benefited more from the reform than firms in non-\ntradable industries is also consistent with another channel through which financial inclusion\npolicies can promote economic development, namely the \u201cbank liquidity channel.\u201d31Indeed,\nfirms and households need a place to safely store their liquidity and transact with others.\nThis is particularly true for firms in tradable industries that need to pay suppliers and receive\ncustomer payments from firms that are physically far away. Banks provide such services,\nwhich facilitate trade and business transactions (see Xu and Yang (2022) for an example in\n19th-century US).\n5.2.2 Why do local branches matter? The role of distance\nNext, we investigate why the presence of local banks appears to relax firms\u2019 financial con-\nstraints. A classic assumption in the macro-development and finance literature is that geo-\ngraphical proximity reduces banks\u2019 monitoring and screening costs (e.g., Greenwood, Sanchez,\nand Wang, 2010; Ji, Teng, and Townsend, 2023) in particular in the presence of soft infor-\nmation (e.g., Rajan and Zingales, 2001; Hombert and Matray, 2017), which is prevalent in\ndeveloping countries.\nThe main prediction of these models is that the effect of the policy should increase with the\nex-ante distance to the nearest bank. We test this prediction in two ways. First, we compare\ncities with a local (private) bank before the reform with cities that did not have a private\nbank by interacting the Treated\u00d7Post variable with a dummy variable No Private Bank cthat\ntakes the value one if the city did not have a private bank pre-reform. Second, within the set\nof treated cities that have no bank branches prior to the reform, we compute the distance to\nthe nearest city with a bank (public or private). We estimate the conditional effect of distance\nin the full panel by interacting the main Treated \u00d7Post variable with a dummy equal to one\nif the distance is zero, and then with a continuous variable Distance to the nearest bank that\nis the (log) distance to the nearest bank.\n31. For a survey of the bank liquidity channel, see Drechsler, Savov, and Schnabl (2018) and Dreschler,\nSavov, and Schnabl (2018). We would like to thank our editor for suggesting this channel.\n28This analysis also allows us to test whether our results are specific to the presence of\ngovernment-controlled banks\u2014for instance, because these banks extend subsidized credit. To\ndo so, we separately interact our main Treated\u00d7Post variable with the distance to the nearest\npublic bank and with the distance to the nearest private bank. Intuitively, if our results hinge\non access to subsidized credit, the effect of the reform should be stronger for cities that were\nfar from a government-controlled bank than for those that were far from a private bank.\nWe report these results in Table 5. In panel A, we show that our results are much stronger\nin cities with no bank presence prior to the reform. Cities without a local private bank\nbefore the reform experience a larger increase in the number of firms (10.4%, column 1), in\nemployment (13.9%, column 2), and in average wages (7%, column 5). In panel B, we show\nthat, conditional on not having a local private bank pre-reform, the real effects of financial\ninclusion increase with the distance to the nearest bank.\nBoth sets of results are consistent with the reform promoting economic development by\nreducing the distance between borrowers and lenders, which lowers the monitoring and screen-\ning costs of financial intermediaries. This idea is also consistent with the result that small\nfirms (fewer than 20 employees) benefit more from the reduction in distance than large firms\n(column 3 vs. 4), in line with the idea that small firms are more opaque and more intensive\nin soft information.\nThe fact that the effect of the reform on economic development increases with the initial\ndistance of treated cities to existing bank branches is also consistent with the \u201cbank liquidity\nchannel.\u201d Indeed, a reduction in distance to a branch may matter simply because it makes it\nless costly to access liquidity services.\nIn panels C and D, we report similar results for the distance to the nearest public and\nprivate bank, respectively. Across all variables, we find that the conditional effect of distance\nis quantitatively similar whether we measure distance to public banks (panel C) or private\nbanks (panel D). These findings suggest that our results are not specific to services provided\nby government-controlled banks, such as access to subsidized credit. Indeed, if access to\ngovernment-owned banks mattered in itself, we should find a larger effect of distance to a\npublic bank relative to the distance to a private bank.\n5.3 Discussion of the reform\nInterpretation: improved access to financial services. The permanent shift in financial\ndevelopment, the similar increase in deposits and credit, the sustained economic development\nprincipally driven by the growth of the tradable sector, and the fact that these effects increase\nwith the ex-ante distance to a bank branch imply that the financial policy we study fostered\naccess to mainstream financing services for firms.\n29Table 5: Financial Frictions, the Role of Distance\nDep\nendent variable # Firms Employment Employment Employment Average\nall small firms large firms wage\n(1)\n(2) (3) (4) (5)\nP\nanel A: Private bank before the reform\nT\nreated\u00d7Post 0.054*** 0.042*** 0.111*** 0.050*** 0.012*\n(0.014) (0.016) (0.026) (0.020) (0.006)\nTreated\u00d7Post\u00d7No private bank 0.104*** 0.139*** 0.246*** 0.158*** 0.070***\n(0.023) (0.031) (0.048) (0.038) (0.011)\nPanel B: Distance to nearest bank\nT\nreated\u00d7Post0.054*** 0.042*** 0.111*** 0.050*** 0.012*\n(0.014) (0.016) (0.026) (0.020) (0.006)\nTreated\u00d7Post\u00d7Distance to nearest bank 0.068*** 0.108*** 0.164*** 0.131*** 0.022***\n(0.012) (0.013) (0.034) (0.022) (0.007)\nPanel C: Distance to nearest public bank\nT\nreated\u00d7Post0.054*** 0.042** 0.111*** 0.050** 0.012*\n(0.015) (0.017) (0.028) (0.021) (0.007)\nTreated\u00d7Post\u00d7Distance nearest public bank 0.069*** 0.110*** 0.166*** 0.132*** 0.024***\n(0.012) (0.013) (0.030) (0.020) (0.006)\nPanel D: Distance to nearest private bank\nT\nreated\u00d7Post0.054*** 0.042** 0.111*** 0.050** 0.012*\n(0.015) (0.017) (0.028) (0.021) (0.007)\nTreated\u00d7Post\u00d7Distance nearest private bank 0.070*** 0.113*** 0.174*** 0.136*** 0.026***\n(0.011) (0.013) (0.027) (0.019) (0.007)\nCit\ny FE \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713\nMatch\u00d7Year FE \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713\nObservations 79,995 79,995 79,947 79,995 79,995\nThis table shows the effect of the policy on multiple outcomes interacted with various measures of ex-ante distance between\ntreated cities and existing banks using the difference-in-differences estimator in equation (1). In Panel A, No private bank is a\ndummy equal to one if the treated cities did not have a private bank prior to the reform. In Panel B, Distance to the nearest\nbank is the distance to the nearest city with a bank, for treated cities with no bank prior to the reform. Panel C and D compute\nthis distance for the nearest private and the nearest public bank. Standard errors are clustered at the matching-pair level. ***,\n**, * indicate statistical significance at the 1%, 5%, and 10% levels, respectively.\nThis policy operates through a distinct mechanism that is inconsistent with two alternative\ninterpretations: (i) the reform was a one-time capital infusion coming from outside the city\nthat potentially generated excessive borrowing, and (ii) the policy was a generic government\nspending policy.\nOn (i), the permanent change in the steady state of financial development, together with\nthe sustained economic development over ten-year with no sign of mean reversion, rules out\n30the concern that the policy was fueled by bad loans, as this should trigger a boom-bust cycle.\nOn (ii), the long-lived effect on economic development is also inconsistent with a short-term\nstimulus. In addition, the fact that employment in the tradable sector expands more than\nemployment in the non-tradable sector (Table 4) and that the effect increases proportionally\nwith the distance to the nearest bank are also inconsistent with these results being driven by\nhigher spending in treated cities overall.\nIs the reform beneficial in net? While the reform was successful in terms of fostering sub-\nstantial economic development, it does not necessarily mean that this success is unambiguous.\nIndeed, the cost of operating bank branches in these unbanked cities might be substantial.\nDoing a clear cost-benefit analysis of the program is beyond the scope of this paper and would\nrequire access to data on the total costs of setting up and operating local bank branches, which\ndo not exist to the best of our knowledge.\nNonetheless, ESTBAN contains information about expenses and profitability at the branch\nlevel. This allows us to look at the yearly average expense-to-revenue ratio and ROA for the\npublic branches created in treated cities after the reform, and to compare them to the average\nfor all private branches in control cities and for new private branches in control cities.\nFigure 7plots the evolution between 2005 and 2014, and shows that branches opened in\ntreated cities are not less profitable or more expensive to run than those opened in control\ncities. Panel (a) displays that the average ROA of new branches in treated cities is, if anything,\nhigher than that of new branches in control cities and comparable to the average ROA of all\nbranches, new and existing, in control cities. Panel (b) displays that the average expense-\nto-revenue ratio of new branches in treated and control cities are similar, and only slightly\nhigher than that of all branches in control cities.\nOf course, it is still possible that the fixed costs associated with setting up a bank branch\nare much higher in treated cities. But, conditional on paying this fixed cost, there is no\nevidence that the bank branches of public banks in treated cities are particularly subsidized.\nWhy do banking deserts exist in the first place? The permanent shift in deposits and\ncredit, together with the sustained effect on economic activity that the financial inclusion\npolicy triggered and the similarity in bank branch ROA in treated and control cities, imply\nthat treated cities that received a bank branch were profitable markets. Then why did banks\nnot serve these markets prior to the reform? This question is beyond the scope of our paper,\nbut we discuss possible explanations in Appendix A.2. Briefly, the lack of coverage can be\nexplained by banks being in a situation of monopolistic competition and facing downward-\nsloping demand curves, which implies that banks can maximize their markups and hence their\nprofits by restricting quantities, i.e., limiting their branch expansion.\nOn the cost side, banks might be able to minimize the cost of their branch network by\n31Figure 7: Average ROA and Expense-to-Revenue Ratio\nControl: New branchesTreated: New branches\nControl: All branches\n0.002.004.006.008.01.012 \n2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014\nYear\n(a) ROA\nControl: New branchesTreated: New branches\nControl: All branches\n0.2.4.6.811.2 \n2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014\nYear (b) Expense-to-Revenue Ratio\nThis figure shows the evolution of ROA (panel a) and total operating expenses divided by total operating revenues (panel b) for\nnew branches in treated and control cities, defined as branches that were opened after the reform, as well as for all branches in\ncontrol cities.\nextending their network in a capillary way and only up to a certain limit. In addition, the\nexistence of sunk costs in setting up a branch might imply that, while branches are profitable\nonce they operate, the total cost (variable plus fixed cost to set up) might still be too high,\nparticularly if set-up costs are larger in more remote cities. As such, a possible rationale for\nwhy bank branches are not present in treated cities prior to the reform, but their entry has\nsuch a strong positive effect on economic development, is that using public banks to open up\nbranches in unbanked cities is akin to the government subsidizing the set-up cost of a bank\nbranch.\n6 Effects on inequality\n6.1 Aggregate results\nTo study how the aggregate economic gains produced by the financial inclusion policy are\ndistributed in each local labor market, we estimate equation (1) using the wage Gini at the\ncity level as an outcome, as well as the average wage per worker in each bin of the city-level\nwage distribution. We graphically report the result for the evolution of Gini and the change\nin average wage for each quartile of the wage distribution in Figure 8. Figure 8a shows the\neffect of the reform on the Gini coefficient. As before, treated cities display no differential\npre-trend prior to the reform. Following the reform, we find a continuous increase in Gini,\nimplying an increase in wage inequality. The magnitude is substantial, with treated cities\nhaving a Gini index that is two points higher ten years after the reform relative to control\n32cities, which represents an increase of 7% relative to the pre-reform mean.\nWhile this result shows that higher financial development leads to higher inequality, it\ndoes not tell us why the Gini is increasing in treated cities.\nWe therefore unpack the evolution of Gini by computing the average wage for each quartile\nof the city wage distribution to better understand the source of the overall change in inequality.\nTo do so, we estimate the distribution of wage within each city-year cell, split the sample into\nquartiles, and take the mean wage in each cell.\nFigure 8b reports the evolution of each wage quartile. Consistent with the idea that\neconomic development is a \u201ctide that lifts all boats,\u201d we find that all workers benefit from\nthe reform. However, workers in the first quartile of the distribution (the purple line) gain\nfar less than workers in the last quartile (the red line), and wage gains increase monotonically\nwith the initial position in the wage distribution.\nTable 6 reports estimates of equation (1). The point estimates tend to underestimate the\neffect of the reform on inequality since, as Figure 8bshows, inequality rises steadily over time,\nwhile these regression results show the average over the whole post-reform period. The Gini\nincreases on average by 1.2 points (column 1), which is driven by larger wages gains at the\ntop of the income distribution. Individuals in the bottom quartile of the wage distribution\nexperience an increase in their average wage of 1% (column 2), while individuals in the top\nquartile see their wages increase by 5.5% (column 5), five time more.\n33Figure 8: Effect of the Program on Wage Inequality\n-.0050.005.01.015.02 \n2000 2002 2004 2006 2008 2010 2012\nYear\n(a) Gini index\n[0-25th][25th-50th][50th-75th]75th+\n0.04.08.12 \n2000 2002 2004 2006 2008 2010 2012 2014\nYear\n(b) Wage distribution\nThis figure plots the yearly coefficients and 95% confidence intervals of the difference-in-differences estimator in equation (1) of\nthe 2004 bank reform on city-level wage Gini (Figure 8a).

First, financial development might lead to better employer-employee matching. This\ncould happen either because looser financial constraints on individuals allow them to search\nlonger and to find a better job match, or because less severe financial frictions can allow\nproductive firms to front-load wages and attract more productive workers, resulting in a\nreduction in labor misallocation and higher wages at the top of the distribution.\nSecond, financial development can foster higher labor demand for skilled workers relative\nto unskilled workers. Financial frictions can directly impact labor demand if there is a mis-\nmatch between payments to labor and the generation of cash-flows or if labor has a fixed-cost\ncomponent due to hiring and firing costs (Schoefer, 2021; Benmelech, Bergman, and Seru,\n2021). Since skilled workers require higher wages and are arguably more expensive to recruit\nand train, financial frictions disproportionately constrain the demand for skilled labor and,\nwhen lessened by the reform, lead to an increase in the demand for skilled labor relative to\nunskilled labor.\nAlternatively, if capital and skilled labor are relative complements, looser financial con-\nstraints can increase capital investment and, consequently, increase the marginal productivity\nof skilled workers relative to unskilled workers, also leading to an increase in the relative\ndemand for skilled workers (Fonseca and Doornik, 2021). A testable implication of either ver-\nsion of the skilled labor demand hypothesis is that, as the relative demand for skilled workers\n35rises, both the relative price and the relative quantity of skilled workers should rise, leading\nto an increase in the skill premium andin the share of skilled workers in treated cities.\nThird, labor demand might go up uniformly across the skill distribution, but the supply\nof unskilled workers could be more elastic than the supply of skilled workers. In this case, the\nskill composition of firms remains stable, but the price of skilled workers goes up, particularly\nso in cities facing higher shortages of skilled workers.\nBetter matching. To test if the matching between workers and firms improves following\nthe reform, we build on Eeckhout and Kircher (2011) and Lopes de Melo (2018), which give\na structural interpretation to the firm fixed effects in Abowd, Kramarz, and Margolis (1999)\nregressions and show that better matching should reduce the dispersion of worker ability\nwithin the firm.32\nWe proxy for worker type with the average log wage over all job spells. We compute\nthe standard deviation of worker types at the firm-year level, residualize the variable from\nfirm fixed effects to account for changes in industry-city composition over time, and take the\nmean of the residualized dispersion in worker types at the 2-digit-industry-by-city level for\neach year. We can then test whether the average dispersion declines as a consequence of the\nreform.33\nTable 7 shows results of this exercise. Across all specifications, we find that if anything,\nthe within-firm dispersion in worker type increases (by a small amount relative to the pre-\nreform average of 0.34). This is the opposite of what we would expect from an improvement\nin employer-employee matching, which should lead to lower within-firm dispersion in worker\ntypes.\nIncrease in demand for skilled workers. To test whether a change in the relative demand\nfor skilled workers can explain the rise in wage inequality, we need an ex-ante, time-invariant\ndefinition of skill. We leverage the fact that the Brazilian matched employer-employee data\nallow us to observe education and classify workers as skilled if they have at least some college\neducation and unskilled otherwise.34\nIn Table 8, we start by showing that this measure tracks the evolution of inequality well.\nIn column 1, we show that the skill premium increases by 8.3% (column 1) and that this\nincrease is driven by a much faster increase in the wage of skilled workers (+11.8%, column\n2) than unskilled workers (+2.8%, column 3). These magnitudes are actually bigger than the\n32. Another potential way of testing for sorting would be to study the correlation between firm and worker\nfixed effects, but, as Eeckhout and Kircher (2011) and Lopes de Melo (2018) show, this correlation does not\nmeasure the strength of sorting in a general setting.\n33. See Bombardini, Orefice, and Tito (2019) for an application of this method in a trade context.\n34. This is a less stringent definition than studies looking at developed countries who use college education\nas a proxy, since we include college dropouts in our definition of skilled.\n36Table 7: Dispersion in Worker Type\nDep\nendent variable: Std.

While the coefficient for the share of skilled workers is positive and signifi-\ncant at 10%, the magnitude (+0.2%) is very small compared to the 8% increase in the skill\npremium. This suggests that other frictions, such as labor supply constraints, are necessary\nin order to explain the bulk of our results. In Appendix Table A9, we show that we find\nsimilar results at the industry-by-city level controlling for time-varying industry shocks.\nConstraints in the supply of skilled workers. To argue that a city\u2019s own supply of skilled\nworkers is a driver of higher wage inequality, we first need to establish that worker mobility\nacross cities is limited. To do so, we exploit the panel dimension of our data to decompose the\nnumber of workers in a given city-year into \u201clocal,\u201d defined as workers who are already in the\ncity prior to the reform, \u201cmovers,\u201d defined as workers who were living in a different city prior\nto the reform, and \u201cnew,\u201d defined as workers who appear for the first time in labor-market\ndata in a given city and did not come from another city.\nTable 9estimates the effect of the reform on the composition of workers across these three\ngroups for all workers (columns 1\u20133) and skilled workers only (columns 4\u20136). We find that\nthe reform has no effect on the share of workers coming from other cities in general (column\n37Table 8: Demand for Skilled Workers\nDependent variable Skill premium Wage skilled Wage unskilled Share skilled\n(1) (2) (3) (4)\nTreated\u00d7Post 0.083*** 0.118*** 0.028*** 0.002*\n(0.010) (0.012) (0.006) (0.001)\nCity FE \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713\nMatch\u00d7Year FE \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713\nObservations 79,901 79,901 79,995 79,995\nThis table shows the effect of the reform on the skill premium (column 1), the average wage of skilled and unskilled workers\n(columns 2 and 3), and the share of workers that are skilled (column 4) at the city level.

This implies that the reform had a limited effect on domestic migration and that\ncities that benefited from the financial inclusion policy did not experience an important inflow\nof skilled workers.\nTable 9: Worker Migration\nSample:\nAll workers Skilled workers\nDep\nendent variable: Share local Share movers Share new Share local Share movers Share new\n(1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6)\nT\nreated\u00d7Post -0.019*** 0.000 0.021*** -0.021*** 0.007*** 0.020***\n(0.004) (0.001) (0.004) (0.006) (0.002) (0.005)\nCit\ny FE \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713\nMatch\u00d7Year FE \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713\nObservations 79,995 79,995 79,995 79,901 79,901 79,901\nThis table shows the effect of the reform on the share of workers by migration status at the city level.

All dependent\nvariables are in arcsin-logs. Standard errors are clustered at the matching-pair level. ***, **, * indicate statistical significance\nat the 1%, 5%, and 10% levels, respectively.\nWhile the low domestic migration of skilled workers following the reform might seem\nsurprising given the skill premium increase in treated cities, this can be explained by the\nexistence of very large migration costs in Brazil, particularly for residents of poor cities (e.g.,\nPorcher, 2020). We provide evidence for this hypothesis by estimating how the migration\nresponse varies as a function of migration cost. We proxy for migration cost using the share\nof movers during the pre-reform period and split the data into deciles of migration cost. We\n38then estimate the effect of the reform on the share of within-country migrants for each decile\nof the migration cost distribution. Figure A4 in the Appendix reports the results. Consistent\nwith outsiders being attracted by a higher skill premium when migration costs are low, we\nfind an increase in the share of migrant workers in the first decile of migration cost, with an\nincrease of 1%. However, this effect sharply drops to zero at the second decile and remains\naround zero afterwards.\nGiven the low rate of internal migration, an increase in the demand for labor (skilled and\nunskilled) can only be met by local workers. To proxy for the potential supply of skilled\nlabor, we use the share of the local population with 11 years or more of education from the\n2000 Demographic Census. The intuition behind this measure is that if a treated city faces\na shortage of skilled workers, we should observe an abnormally large skill premium. In order\nto determine what is abnormally large, we compare the skill premium in treated cities with\nthe skill premium in the same industry-by-firm-size category in control cities.\nOur measure of the relative supply of skilled labor is based on the population census,\nwhich has the advantage of neither being affected by the fraction of workers in the informal\nsector, nor reflecting the equilibrium outcomes in the formal labor market. As a robustness\ncheck, we supplement this measure by computing a measure of the \u201cskill gap\u201d at the city\nlevel to construct that measure. We split firms into employment size quartiles according to\nthe city-year distribution and, for each year in the pre-reform period, we compute the skill\npremium in each city-industry-firm-size cell for both treated and control cities. We then take\nthe ratio of treated to control skill premium at the industry-firm-size level and define the skill\ngap as the city-level mean of all industry-firm-size ratios in a given city.\nWe split both measures along the sample median and interact each dummy with all the\nvariables, including the fixed effects. Table 10reports the results. The increase in Gini\n(column 1) is entirely explained by the increase in inequality in cities where the fraction\nof skilled workers is low (column 2). Since we use an interaction term, the coefficient on\nthe variable Treated \u00d7Post shows the result for the sub-sample of cities that are below the\nmedian of the supply of skilled labor. The total effect for cities with high supply skilled labor\nis obtained by adding the coefficient of Treated \u00d7Post with the marginal interaction term.\nIrrespective of the proxy (columns 2 and 3), we find that the total effect of the policy on\ninequality for cities with a high supply of skilled workers is much smaller (column 2), and it is\nclose to zero when we measure the supply of skilled workers with the share of population with\nsome college education (column 3). In Appendix Table A10, we show that these results are\nrobust to using continuous versions of these skill supply measures and adding a wide range of\ncontrol variables.\n39Table 10: Effect on Gini, Heterogeneity in Skill Supply\nDependent variable: Gini\n(1) (2) (3) (4)\nTreated\u00d7Post 0.012*** 0.016*** 0.018*** 0.020***\n(0.002) (0.002) (0.002) (0.003)\nTreated\u00d7Post\u00d7Low skill gap -0.008*** -0.006**\n(0.003) (0.003)\nTreated\u00d7Post\u00d7High share skilled population -0.014*** -0.013***\n(0.003) (0.003)\nCity\u00d7Industry FE \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713\nMatch\u00d7Year FE \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713\nObservations 79,995 79,995 79,995 79,995\nThis table shows the effect of the reform the Gini index at the city-by-(2 digit) industry level.

Standard errors are clustered at the matching-pair level. ***, **, * indicate statistical significance at\nthe 1%, 5%, and 10% levels, respectively.\n7 Robustness\n7.1 City-industry level estimation\nControlling for industry-dynamics. Even though pre-reform covariates are balanced\nacross treated and control cities (Figure 3) and we show in Appendix Table A5 that our\nresults are robust to directly controlling for these levels, it is possible that industry-specific\nshocks post 2004 might affect our results. Alleviating these concerns requires us to work at\nthe city-by-industry level. However, since we observe entry and exit of industries at the city\nlevel, the baseline specification of equation (1) does not guarantee that aggregate results at\nthe city level (which capture the extensive margins by construction) are preserved when we\ndisaggregate the data at the city-by-industry level.\nWe are able to provide an alternative estimation that does ensure this aggregation property.\nWe modify our baseline specification in two ways. First, we create a balanced panel by\nassuming that each industry we observe at any point in a given city is present during the\nwhole sample period, and we fill observations without firms in an industry with zero. Second,\nwe collapse the data into two periods: the average \u201cpre\u201d (t < 2004) and the average \u201cpost\u201d\n(t\u22652004). We then compute the mid-point growth rate for all our different outcomes, that\nwe define for a variable X as: gX\nj,c= (Xt\u2212Xt\u22121)/[(X j,c,t+Xj,c,t\u22121)\u00d70.5].\n40Specifically, we estimate the following equation at the city c, industry j, period tlevel:\n\u2206Yc,j,t=\u03b21Treated c\u00d7Post t+\u03b4j,t+\u03b5c,j,t (3)\nSince \u2206 Yp,c,j,t is the change between the pre and post period, we do not need to include\ncity\u00d7industry fixed effects as they are already differenced out, but we do include industry-\nby-pair-by-time fixed effects \u03b4j,t.\nThis specification has two appealing properties. First, it handles entry and exit of indus-\ntries without relying on transformations of the log function (such as \u201cx+1\u201d), that are always\nsensitive to small variations around zero. Second, it ensures that the coefficient at the city-\nindustry level aggregates exactly to the coefficient at the city level when using the correct\nweights, which is not possible with the non-linear log function. The weights are defined as\nthe share of the denominator in the total city-period cell. For each industry jin city c, we\nuse the mid-point growth rate for a variable X in city cand industry j gX\nj,c, and compute the\nweight as gX\nj,c/(P\nj\u2208cgX\nj,c).35\nThis specification allows us to include industry-by-year fixed effects (or even industry-\nby-match-by-year fixed effects), which ensures that the effect of the reform is now estimated\nby comparing the same industry across treated and control cities in the same matched pair.\nThis implies, for instance, that even if treated cities are more dependent on the commodity\nsector in the midst of a commodity boom, these industry-specific dynamics will not bias our\nestimates.\nIn Table 11, we start by reproducing the baseline results at the city-by-industry level. In\ncolumns (1) and (4), we report results at the city level and show that they are very close to the\nbaseline city-level results of Table 3. In columns (2) and (5), we show that the point estimates\nareidentical at the city-industry level with the weighting described above. Finally, in columns\n(3) and (6), we show that the inclusion of match\u00d7year \u00d7industry fixed effects yield, if anything,\nlarger point estimates. In this case, the identification relies solely on comparing outcomes in\nthe same industry within a given group of treated-control cities. These additional fixed effects\nensure that our baseline effects are not driven by industry shocks that might correlate with\nthe reform and the sectoral composition of treated cities.\nEstimating the underlying change in firm dynamics. An additional advantage of this\nindustry-level specification that both accommodates zeros and uses a linear estimator is that\nwe can exactly decompose the change in the number of firms in the cross section of cities\ninto the evolution of entry and exit. To measure firm entry and exit, we count the number of\nfirms entering or leaving the city each year and set the year 2000 to zero. This allows us to\n35. In our case, we multiply this weight by the population in 2000 in order to be able to exactly reproduce\nthe city level results, which does not affect the aggregation property.\n41decompose the change in the number of firms in a industry-city dell c, jas:\n\u2206Firms c,j=Firms c,j,2014\u2212Firms c,j,2000\nFirms c,j,2000=t=2014P\nt=2001Entry c,j,t\u2212t=2014P\nt=2001Exit c,j,t\nFirms c,j,2000\nWe report the results in columns 7 and 8 of Table 11. We find that the reform leads to a\nsubstantial increase in both firm entry andexit, supporting the view that financial develop-\nment fosters a process of creative destruction. In terms of magnitude, the increase in the\nnumber of new firms created is almost two time bigger than the increase in number of firms\n(column 7 vs. column 6), which highlights the importance of having panel data rather than\ncross-sectional data in order to fully grasp changes in firm dynamics as positive local shocks\naccelerate churn.\nTable 11: Effect on Economic Development, City-Industry Level\nDep\nendent Variable Employment # Firms Entry Exit\nUnit\nof analysis City City \u00d7Ind.

Of\nspecial concern is the far-reaching cash transfer program Bolsa Fam\u00b4 \u0131lia, which was introduced\none year before our reform, in 2003. We think that this concern is unlikely to explain our\nresults for four reasons.\nFirst, this mechanism is inconsistent with some of our results: (i) additional income from\ngovernment programs could serve as a positive income shock, fostering growth by driving up\nlocal demand. This would imply that non-tradable sectors grow faster than tradable sectors,\nwhich is the exact opposite of what we find in Table 4. (ii) While government transfers\n42can affect income inequality, there is no reason it should affect wage inequality a priori. A\npossible connection would be that higher government transfers increase the reservation wage\nof workers, but this would imply an increase in workers\u2019 bargaining power that should mostly\nbenefit workers at the bottom of the wage distribution, thereby predicting a reduction in wage\ninequality rather than the increase we find in Figure 8.\nSecond, the most ambitious programs, such as Bolsa Fam\u00b4 \u0131lia, are distributed directly by\ngovernment-owned banks. Since our control cities have a branch of a public bank by design,\nthis implies that control cities have the same access as treated cities to government programs\ndisbursed through government-controlled banks.\nThird, we show in Figure 3that treated and control cities are similar in their government\nexpenditures, as well as in the likelihood that the mayor is affiliated with Lula\u2019s party (the\nWorker\u2019s Party). Therefore, even if, post 2004, the Lula government decided to expand social\ntransfers particularly to places with more left-leaning voters, both treated and control cities\nwould benefit from such an expansion in the same way.\nFourth, we test if the point estimates for our main outcomes are affected when we directly\ncontrol for total local government expenditures or the political affiliation of the mayor. We\nshow in Appendix Table A5that our results remain quantitatively the same when controlling\nonly for local government expenditures (column 14), whether the mayor is affiliated to Lula\u2019s\nparty (column 15) or both at the same time (column 16) . The inclusion of these controls\nimply that the effect of the reform is estimated by comparing cities that have similar political\ninclinations and welfare spending. We also show in Appendix Table A6that results are\nsimilar when we include state \u00d7year fixed effects, implying that differences in state-level welfare\nprograms or differences in political incentives at the state level cannot explain our results.\nFinally, we provide additional evidence that our results are not driven by government\nprograms by exploiting the fact that some of the largest government programs, like Bolsa\nFam\u00b4 \u0131lia, are distributed by a specific government bank: Caixa Econ\u02c6 omica Federal. If our\nresults were driven by Bolsa Fam\u00b4 \u0131lia or other welfare programs, they would be strongest when\ntreated cities are compared with control cities that did nothave a branch of Caixa, as, in this\ncase, treated cities would benefit from the welfare program expansion and control cities would\nnot since, by construction, control cities do not have access to the distributor of the program.\nWe report results of this exercise in Table A8in the Appendix. Unlike what we would expect\nif results were driven by government programs, we find that, if anything, results are weaker\nwhen no Caixa branches were present in control cities prior to the reform.\n437.3 Sample composition\nOur results on changes in inequality might be partially driven by a change in the worker\ncomposition in treated cities. Inequalities might increase for instance because following the\nreform, more low productivity workers enter the sample, pushing the mean wage of low-\nskill workers downward. We investigate this possibility in Table 12, in which we measure\ninequality using the city-level variance of log wage.36This allows us to measure wages as the\nresidual of a Mincer equation including different worker characteristics. The inclusion of these\ncharacteristics is equivalent to holding fixed the sample composition along these dimensions.\nIn column 1, we report the result when we use the raw wage. In column 2, we add a third-\norder polynomial on age and fixed effects for sex and seven categories of race.37In column 3\nwe include 2-digit industry fixed effects and in column 4 we include 2-digit industry-by-2 digit\noccupation fixed effects (4,479 distinct dummies). Finally, in columns 5 and 6, we use the\nunfiltered wage, but restrict to the sample of workers present from 2004 to 2014 (column 5)\nand to firms present prior to the reform (column 6) to estimate whether our effect are driven\nby a change in the entry / exit of workers or firms.38Across all the different level of controls,\nwe find an overall stable effect of the reform, with higher financial development leading to\nmore inequality.\n7.4 Informality and exposure to commodity sector\nNote that columns 5 and 6 of Table 12show that our results are robust to restricting to\nworkers and firms already in the formal sector, and thus suggest our findings are not driven\nby workers and firms moving into or out of the informal sector. We complement these results\nby controlling for the city-level employment in the informal sector from the 2000 Census,\nwhich we include as one of controls in column (6) of Table A5in the Appendix. This confirms\nonce again that our results are not driven by the informal sector. These results are in line\nwith the fact that treated and control cities have the same level of informality prior to the\nshock, as shown in the covariate balance test of Figure 3.\nWe also directly test if exposure to the commodity sector could explain our results by\ncontrolling for employment in the commodity sector (column 9 of Table A5), or for the\n36. We use the variance instead of the Gini here because the Gini requires only positive values, but residu-\nalizing wages leads to potential negative values. By contrast, the variance is always well defined.\n37. There are six race categories in RAIS: Indigenous, White, Black, Asian, multiracial, and not reported.\nWe also include missing race values as a seventh category so as not to exclude those observations from this\nanalysis.\n38. Results are similar when we require firms to be present throughout the period. We only condition on\nfirms exiting pre-reform because the increase in firm exit post reform and workers losing their firm-specific\nhuman capital or firm-specific shared rent could be a channel through which financial development affects\ninequality.\n44Table 12: Variance of Wages\nDep\nendent variable Var[log(Wage)]\nFixed\neffects None Age \u00d7Sex Industry Industry Workers Firms\n\u00d7Race \u00d7Occupation 2004\u20132014 2004\n(1)\n(2) (3) (4) (5) (6)\nT\nreated\u00d7Post 0.015*** 0.014*** 0.011*** 0.010*** 0.021*** 0.013***\n(0.002) (0.002) (0.002) (0.002) (0.003) (0.002)\nCit\ny FE \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713\nMatch\u00d7Year FE \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713\nObservations 79,995 79,995 79,995 79,995 79,980 79,995\nThis table shows the effect of the reform on the change in the variance of log(wage) at the city level. From columns 2 to 5, we\nuse as the wage the residual of a Mincerian regression, after we have filtered a polynomial of age (age, age-square, age-cube)\nand fixed effects for gender and seven race categories (column 2), added 2-digit industry fixed effects (column 3), and 2-digit\nindustries\u00d7 2 digit occupation fixed effects (column 4)). In columns (5) and (6), we use the unfiltered wage, but restrict to the\nsample of workers present from 2004 to 2014 (column 5) and to firms present prior to the reform (column 6).

We construct this variable as the weighted sum of\nprices across the fourteen main commodities in Brazil, similar to the measure developed by\nBenguria, Saffie, and Urz\u00b4 ua (2018).39Our results remain quantitatively the same, consistent\nwith the analysis of Table 11, where we non-parametrically control for sector-specific shocks.\n7.5 Other robustness checks\nAs we discuss in Section 3, we conduct a number of other robustness checks relating to our\nmatching procedure and empirical specification.\nWe show in Table A3in the appendix that results are robust to using different numbers\nof control cities. In Table A4, we show results are not sensitive to the matching procedure.\nIn panel A we replicate our results in the baseline sample. In panel B, we additionally exact\nmatch on quintiles of the share of skilled workers pre-reform. In panel C, we exact match\non quintiles of the share of manufacturing pre-reform and, in panel D, we exact match on\nquintiles of the level of inequality pre-reform. In all cases, the point estimates of all the\noutcomes are quantitatively very similar.\nIn Table A5, we include a collection of additional city-level controls, such as GDP, em-\nployment, skilled employment, political affiliation of the mayor, trade, distance to the state\ncapital, and the comovement of local GDP with aggregate fluctuations. These results help\nrule out the possibility that our results are driven by differential exposure of treated cities to\naggregate shocks or by political connections. In particular, including for state-by-year fixed\neffects implies that we control for any state-level political cycles, and controlling for the po-\n39. We would like to thank the authors for generously sharing their measure with us.\n45litical affiliation of the mayor implies that we estimate our effects by comparing cities where\nmayors have the same political affiliation.\nGiven that the reform may have a direct impact on many city characteristics, we control\nfor the pre-reform value of these characteristics interacted with year fixed effects. Finally, we\nalso show in Table A6 in the Appendix that results are robust to adding state-by-year fixed\neffects to control for time-varying unobserved variation across regions of Brazil.\n8 Relation to macro-development models\nThis paper presents causal evidence on the effect of financial inclusion on economic develop-\nment and inequality, which can provide moments to inform and discipline macro-development\nmodels that study these relationships. Our paper also highlights margins not present in\nexisting models, which could help future models better match the dynamics of financial\ndevelopment and wage inequality. In this section, we discuss how our estimates relate to\nmacro-development models and summarize key moments that these models may target.\nRole of access to financial intermediaries. Our results highlight the importance of bank\nentry and financial inclusion on economic development. One recent model that explicitly\nconsiders how the distance to the nearest bank affects the cost and availability of both credit\nand savings instruments, such as deposits, is Ji, Teng, and Townsend (2023). In this model,\nthe amount of borrowing depends on the share of wealth that entrepreneurs can pledge (i.e.,\nthe tightness of the borrowing constraint), which is itself a function of cash savings, deposit\nsavings and an upfront market-specific credit entry cost. Both the upfront credit entry cost\nand the cost of adjusting balances on interest-earning savings products depend linearly on the\ndistance to the nearest bank. Table 1 of Ji, Teng, and Townsend (2023) reports calibrating\nthe slope of the credit entry cost to the sensitivity of loan access to bank distance and of the\nportfolio adjustment cost to the sensitivity of the deposit-to-cash ratio to bank distance, with\nboth sensitivities being obtained from empirical correlations.\nOur estimates of the effect of financial inclusion on credit and deposits can provide causal\nmoments to help identify the slope of the relationship between bank distance and the credit\nentry cost and the portfolio adjustment cost, respectively. As we discuss in Section 5, our\nresults are best interpreted as the effect of bank entry or, alternatively, as a reduction in the\ndistance to the nearest bank to zero.40\nTo map more closely the parameters used in macro-models, we re-estimate equation (1)\n40. The pre-reform average distance to the nearest bank for treated cities is 8.66 kilometers. Restricting\nattention to treated cities initially without a private bank, the pre-reform average distance to the nearest bank\nis 23.59 kilometers.\n46using credit and deposits among new branches scaled by the city GDP. In Table A1, we\nreport an increase in credit of 2.3% of the city GDP and in deposits of 2.5% of the city\nGDP for treated cities relative to control cities.41Note that, since we do not observe banking\ncorrespondents, these estimates likely represent a lower bound, as they do not capture the\nexpansion in credit in cities that only received a banking correspondent and not a bank branch.\nConditioning on treated cities that did receive a branch of a public bank, we estimate an\nincrease in loans of 3.4% of GDP and in deposits of 2.4%.\nFinally, the results on economic development that we present in Table 3can also be used\nto evaluate model predictions about employment, firm growth, and wages as a result of this\nexpansion in access to banks, thus providing additional identified moments that can be used\nto discipline macro-finance development models.\nExternal financing and economic development. A broader class of models does not\nexplicitly consider the extensive margin of access to credit but includes credit market frictions\nthat, when severe enough, will imply that the economy operates close to autarky.42Our\nresults are most supportive of frictions relating to monitoring costs, such as credit entry\ncosts or intermediation costs (e.g., Greenwood and Jovanovic, 1990; Greenwood, Sanchez,\nand Wang, 2010; Dabla-Norris, Ji, Townsend, and Unsal, 2021) but might also help inform\na large literature that models credit frictions as a reduced-form collateral constraint, which\ncan represent a wide range of credit-market imperfections (see references in the literature\nreview). The results on economic development that we present in Table 3can be used to\nevaluate model predictions as a response to a reduction in financial frictions that leads to an\nincrease in new loans corresponding to 1.7% (lower bound) to 3.2% (upper bound) of GDP.\nHowever, we highlight that our results most likely speak to the effect of financial inclusion and\nnot simply a credit expansion where credit is already available. The large effect on economic\ndevelopment that we identify, which is considerably larger for treated cities that are farther\naway from a nearby bank (Table 5), points toward the existence of a non-linearity around\nvery low levels of external finance. In that case, this evaluation would only be appropriate in\nan environment where the baseline level of financial frictions is severe enough to imply that\nthere is initially little to no credit.\nImportance of worker heterogeneity. In the workhorse model of occupational choice\nwith financial constraints (e.g., Gin\u00b4 e and Townsend, 2004; Buera, Kaboski, and Shin, 2011),\n41. The average GDP per capita of treated cities between 2000 and 2014 is BRL 9,212.05.\n42. The literature so far has mostly modeled three types of financial constraints: credit entry costs, which\ncapture fixed transaction costs to access credit; a collateral constraint, which limits loan amounts by pledgeable\nassets; and intermediation costs, modeled as a wedge between the interest rate charged on loans and the deposit\nrate. A recent paper by Dabla-Norris, Ji, Townsend, and Unsal (2021) offers a framework to include the three\nfrictions directly in a standard macro-development model.\n47agents are heterogeneous in wealth and entrepreneurial productivity, and can choose to be\nworkers or entrepreneurs. If they decide to be a worker, they are paid the equilibrium wage.43\nTherefore, while the average wage is affected by who becomes an entrepreneur\u2014as this affects\naggregate labor demand and supply\u2014the gains accrue equally to all workers, as individuals\nare homogeneous in their labor productivity.\nThe type of inequality that this class of models is able to study is therefore wealth in-\nequality, or income inequality, i.e., the sum of capital income (which is the business income of\nentrepreneurs and the interest income households obtain from interest-bearing saving prod-\nucts) and labor income. In this case, capital income is usually a force that pushes income\ninequality up with financial development, and labor income is a force that pushes income\ninequality down.\nOur paper focuses on labor income inequality (i.e., wage inequality). It shows that wage\ninequality increases with financial development when workers are heterogeneous, suggesting\nthat incorporating skill heterogeneity in macro-finance development models is important to\nfully explain how finance affects inequality. Indeed, even in a country like Brazil, the vast ma-\njority of the population are workers and not entrepreneurs. This is important because, while\nincome inequality is likely larger than wage inequality, wage inequality potentially matters a\ngreat deal for aggregate inequality. According to the 2000 Census, we find that the Gini wage\ninequality index among employees is 0.54, barely smaller than the total income inequality\nindex of 0.60 among the total population (employees plus entrepreneurs).44\n9 Conclusion\nIn this paper, we show that the expansion of financial access and capital deepening promoted\nby the Brazilian government led to a permanent increase in economic development, driven\nboth by an expansion of existing businesses and an increase in firm creation, which accelerated\nthe exit of existing firms. These effects materialize over time, underlying the need to study a\nlong-enough period to capture the true effect of one-time reforms on long-run development.\nThis important economic development triggered a substantial rise in wage inequality, which\nis mostly explained by the limited supply of skilled labor in some cities. This result raises the\nquestion of whether governments should also implement simultaneous labor-oriented policies\nin order to reap the full benefit of formal financial market policies.\n43. A notable exception is Cagetti and De Nardi (2006) who allows individuals to have different productivity\nas workers and entrepreneurs, but focus on wealth inequality.\n44. The fact that a large part of the Gini index of total income is explained by wages in the aggregate is not\nthat surprising since, in Brazil, over 72% of the population are employees and not entrepreneurs. This high\nfraction confirms that understanding the drivers of wage inequality among employees is an important avenue\nfor better understanding how financing frictions affect aggregate inequality.\n48The importance of financial inclusion also has potential implications for current and future\npolicy on digital banking. Such policies are already underway in some developing countries\nwith the goal of expanding financial access, including in Brazil with the launch of an instant\npayment platform (Pix) and its mandatory use by all financial institutions and payment\ninstitutions that are licensed by the Central Bank of Brazil. This initiative, by improving\ndeposit provisions and lowering costs of access to liquidity services, should boost development\nand firm growth, particularly in tradable industries. However, whether this initiative alone\nwill achieve its intended goals or if, instead, it would be complementary with the expansion of\nphysical bank branches remains an open debate. It might well be the case that the expected\ngains from Pix will materialize mostly in places where households and businesses are already\nbanked if the initial connection to the formal finance sector requires the physical presence of\na bank branch.\nOur results also imply that policies such as digital banking that increase financial inclusion\nfor retail customers and for small and medium-sized enterprises could be a source of substantial\nincrease in inequality in the future if they interact with other frictions, such as the limited\nsupply of human capital, that are prevalent in many developing countries.\nReferences\nAbowd, John, Francis Kramarz, and David Margolis. 1999. \u201cHigh Wage Workers and High Wage Firms.\u201d Econometrica 67 (2):\n251\u2013333.\nAngrist, Joshua, and J\u00a8 orn-Steffen Pischke. 2008.

National Bureau of Economics\nResearch.\n52A.1 Appendix\nFOR ONLINE PUBLICATION\nA.2 Why do banking deserts exist in developing coun-\ntries?\nThe permanent shift in deposits and credit, together with the sustained effect on economic\nactivity that the financial inclusion policy triggered, implies that treated cities that received\na bank branch were profitable markets. Then why did banks not serve these markets prior to\nthe reform? Two reasons can explain this pattern.\nFirst, on the revenue side, monopolistic competition and downward-sloping demand curves\nimply that banks can maximize their markups and hence their profits by restricting quantities,\nwhich will restrict bank expansion.45The limit on bank network expansion will be amplified\nwhen the uncertainty about the profitability of possible markets is high (e.g., Hellmann,\nMurdock, and Stiglitz, 1997), which is likely the case for many smaller cities in a developing\ncountry like Brazil.46\nSecond, on the cost side, the existence of fixed costs to set up a branch and the need to\nminimize the distance across branches to minimize costs implies that banks do not decide on\nbranch locations in an unconstrained way, but instead will extend their network in a capillary\nway and up to a certain limit, particularly in a country as geographically large as Brazil.\nTherefore, cities where banks would be profitable if historical branch networks were different\nmay remain unbanked.\nThe revenue and cost reasons that explain why banks did not serve these cities before the\nreform can also explain why the entry of public banks did not crowd in private banks, despite\nevidence that these cities have solvent demand.47\n45. Maximizing bank mark-up will result in cities not having a branch under the hypothesis that the geo-\ngraphical market served by a branch can be larger than the administrative unit \u201ccity.\u201d While our data does\nnot allow us to provide direct evidence, this idea is consistent with our results on distance to bank branches\nacross cities in Section 5.2.2 and in line with the findings in Assuncao, Mityakov, and Townsend (2020).\n46. This puzzling feature of limited bank expansion to lower margin but profitable markets is actually a\nfeature that has been found in many countries, including developed countries with an active financial sector\nlike the US. See C\u00b4 elerier and Matray (2019) for evidence and references on this phenomenon.\n47. A way to model why profit-maximizing private banks would not enter following the entry of public banks\nis to have a model where public banks maximize profits while, at the same time, caring about total financial\naccess. Assuncao, Mityakov, and Townsend (2020) shows that such a model can explain well the geographical\nexpansion pattern of government-controlled banks vs. private banks in Thailand.\n53Figure A1: Effect of the Program on Total Credit and Deposits\nTotalPublic\nPrivate\n-10123 \n2000 2002 2004 2006 2008 2010 2012 2014\nYear\n(a) Total credit\nTotal\nPublic\nPrivate\n-1000100200300400 \n2000 2002 2004 2006 2008 2010 2012 2014\nYear (b) Total deposits\nThis figure plots the yearly coefficients and their 95% confidence intervals of the difference-in-differences estimator in equation (1)\nof the 2004 bank reform. Total credit and total deposits are scaled by the city GDP. Each LHS variable is the inverse hyperbolic\nsine transformation of the log function, defined as log[X+ (X2+ 1)1/2].

New Loans per GDP and New Deposits per GDP are, respectively, loans and deposits in 2010 BRL\nfrom branches that were opened after the program, divided by the city population. Note that coefficients prior to 2004 are equal\nto zero by construction.

Empirical findings demonstrate significant growth in\nmanufacturing firms in these districts due to eased credit access, resulting in increased\ncapital accumulation, sales revenue, and employment. However, the expansion predom-\ninantly benefited incumbent firms, with minimal stimulation of firm entry or product\ninnovation. The reform also induced notable labor reallocation towards manufacturing\nsectors, particularly in areas with lower agricultural productivity. To fully understand\nthe aggregate effects of bank expansion and explore policy counterfactuals, we are de-\nveloping a general equilibrium model, which will be calibrated using our micro-level\nestimates.\n\u2020We would like to express our gratitude to Pete Klenow, Eric Verhoogen, and Jack Willis for their\ninvaluable guidance and support throughout the project.

An estimate\nfrom the World Bank posits that approximately 1.7 billion people, primarily residing in\nunderdeveloped countries, are devoid of basic banking facilities, such as checking accounts or\nstandardsavingsproducts( Demirguc-Kuntetal. ,2018). Thissituationstarklycontrastswith\ndeveloped economies like the United States, where a mere 4.5% of households are \u201cunbanked\u201d\n(FDIC,2021). This deprivation from finance could impede economic development by curbing\naggregate investment and employment and distorting capital allocation among firms and\npotential entrepreneurs ( Hsieh and Klenow ,2009;Buera et al. ,2011;Bazzi et al. ,2021;\nFonseca and Matray ,2022).\nMany developing countries have implemented place-based policies to stimulate bank ex-\npansion in lagging regions, believing that these policies have the potential to ignite economic\ngrowth and alleviate poverty through better access to financial services. Previous literature,\nutilizing both Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs) and natural experiments, tends to high-\nlight substantial benefits to industrial growth and household well-being in areas that have\nseen an influx of banking services ( Burgess and Pande ,2005;Bruhn and Love ,2014;Young,\n2017;Cramer,2021;Fonseca and Matray ,2022;Barboni et al. ,2021). However, less is un-\nderstood about the costs and aggregate welfare effects of these programs.1It is conceivable\nthat regions under-served by banks could have an inherently low demand for credit, possibly\ndue to low productivity levels or other market frictions.2Under such conditions, expanding\nthe presence of bank branches in places with low credit demand could be counterproductive\nand even lead to greater misallocation of resources.\nIn this study, we investigate the impacts of bank expansion on firm dynamics and labor\nallocation, employing both empirical and theoretical approaches. Our analysis takes advan-\ntage of a nationwide policy experiment in India, which was implemented by the Reserve\nBank of India in 2005. The purpose of this policy was to encourage the opening of branches\nin \u201cunder-banked\u201d districts\u2014regions where the population-to-branch ratio surpassed the na-\ntional average. This arbitrary policy cutoff presents us with an ideal setting to estimate the\ncausal effects of bank expansion using a regression discontinuity design (RDD), wherein we\ncompare districts that barely exceed or fall below the criterion for being classified as under-\n1One noteworthy exception is Ji et al.(2023), which integrates empirical evidence of branch openings in\nlocal markets with a spatial general equilibrium model to quantify the aggregate effects of bank expansion.\n2Previous studies have shed light on several industrial policies that could potentially contribute to such\nmarket frictions. These policies include priority sector lending ( Banerjee and Duflo ,2014), restrictions on\nForeign Direct Investment (FDI) ( Bau and Matray ,2023), contractual frictions ( Bertrand et al. ,2021), and\nreservationsforSmall-ScaleIndustries( Martinetal. ,2017). Insection4, weoutlinethetheoreticalframework\nfor how such market frictions can affect firm dynamics.\n2banked. The banking industry responded strongly to the policy, leading to an increase in the\nnumber of branches, deposits, and credit in those under-banked districts, thereby creating\nexogenous shocks to financial access.\nLeveraging plant-level data from the Annual Survey of Industries (ASI) database from\n1998 to 2013, we document a significant expansion of manufacturing firms in under-banked\ndistrictspost-reform. Ourfindingsindicatethatthereformeasedfirms\u2019accesstocredit, stim-\nulating capital accumulation and driving growth in sales revenue and employment. However,\nthis growth was exclusively fueled by incumbent firms that employed more resources to in-\ncrease their production of existing products. Contrary to findings in prior studies ( Kerr and\nNanda,2009;Bazzi et al. ,2021;Fonseca and Matray ,2022), the reform failed to spur greater\nfirm dynamics. Although treated districts saw an uptick in the exit rate for small firms\n(with less than 20 employees), the entry rate remained unchanged post-reform. We similarly\nreport that the reform had limited effects on product innovation and creative destruction.\nIn line with the lack of enhanced firm dynamics and product innovation, firms in the treated\ndistricts did not witness an improvement in their Total Factor Productivity (TFP).\nThese findings echo the predictions of our static framework of heterogeneous firms operat-\ning under financial constraints. We document that under-banked districts typically shoulder\nhigher fixed overhead costs, possibly due to ine\ufb00icient industrial regulations. While the bank\nexpansion eased the borrowing constraint on the intensive margin, it did not alleviate the\nfixed overhead costs. Consequently, the reform primarily benefited incumbent firms at the\nexpense of potential entrants.\nTreating each Indian district as a distinct local market, we delve into the reform\u2019s equilib-\nrium impacts by leveraging the village-level population census data.3We observe that bank\nexpansion induced significant labor reallocation towards the manufacturing sector, primar-\nily by creating more manufacturing jobs. This effect is particularly pronounced in villages\nwith lower agricultural productivity, implying that the reform potentially mitigates labor\nmisallocation across different sectors.\nWe are currently developing a general equilibrium model to interpret our results and\n3Treatingeachdistrictasadistinctlocallabormarketisconsistentwithevidenceoflowlevelsofmigration\nin our study context. Existing literature has highlighted substantial labor mobility costs in India, potentially\nconfining labor to agriculture even in the face of low productivity. Munshi and Rosenzweig (2016) highlights\nthat the wage gap between urban and rural areas in India is substantial, with urban wages being over\n47% higher than rural wages for less educated workers engaged in menial tasks. Using detailed district-\nwise migration flow data from the 2001 population census, Kone et al. (2018) underscores that the 5-year\ninter-district migration rate in India is remarkably low, at a mere 2.8%.

This model will be calibrated with our micro-level\nestimates to understand the effects on both aggregate economic growth and the misallocation\nof resources and talent. In addition, we will explore several policy counterfactuals, informed\nby our model\u2019s predictions. For instance, we will investigate the counterfactual effects of\nfurther reducing financial frictions towards zero. Additionally, we aim to understand the\ninterplay between reduced financial frictions and other types of economic frictions.\nThis paper connects most closely to three main streams of literature. First, we add to\na growing body of literature studying the impacts of quasi-experimental and experimental\ncredit shocks in developing countries ( Bazzi et al. ,2021;Breza and Kinnan ,2021;Banerjee\nand Duflo ,2014;Bruhn and Love ,2014;Burgess and Pande ,2005;Fonseca and Matray ,\n2022;Young,2017;Cramer,2021;Barboni et al. ,2021;Egger et al. ,2022). A complementary\napproach exploits RCTs to study the implications of access to credit and saving products in\ndeveloping countries with mixed results (see, for instance, Banerjee et al. (2015) for a review).\nOne explanation for the modest effect of credit access in experimental studies is that they\noften fail to incorporate the general equilibrium effects. Using combined rich micro-data on\nfirms and labor markets, we are able to directly study the general equilibrium impacts of\nthe bank expansion policy. In the context of India, Young(2017) andCramer(2021) have\nexamined and validated the bank expansion policy that we use in the paper.4Our study\nfocuses on industrial growth and structural transformation, providing new perspectives on\nthe aggregate welfare effects of bank expansion.\nSecond, our paper contributes to the large literature on structural transformation, espe-\ncially the impediments to the reallocation of labor from agriculture in developing countries\n(Gollin et al. ,2014;Munshi and Rosenzweig ,2016). There is an ongoing debate about the\ndeterminants of structural transformation. Previous research has emphasized the importance\nof agricultural productivity as the primary \u201clabor push\u201d force ( Gollin et al. ,2002;Ngai and\nPissarides ,2007;Bustos et al. ,2016), as well as the importance of human capital growth\n(Porzio et al. ,2022). On the other hand, an older strand of research has suggested the role\nof the manufacturing sector in the process of structural transformation\u2014the \u201clabor pull\u201d\nhypothesis. This hypothesis posits that growth in the manufacturing sector could result in\nhigher industrial wages and attract surplus labor from the agricultural sector, thereby driving\nthe structural change ( Lewis,1954;Harris and Todaro ,1970;Bencivenga and Smith ,1997;\nGylfason and Zoega ,2006;Alvarez-Cuadrado and Poschke ,2011). Our paper contributes to\nthe literature by providing empirical evidence that manufacturing development acts as a sig-\n4Cramer(2021) shows that the expansion of banks leads to better health outcomes in India. At the\nmacro level, Young(2017) shows that treated districts had faster economic growth, proxied by nighttime\nlight intensity.\n4nificant \u201clabor pull\u201d factor, driving the process of structural transformation and potentially\nreducing labor misallocation.\nIn addition, our paper contributes to the literature on resource misallocation. A leading\nexplanation of cross-country economic disparity is resource misallocation; however, identi-\nfying specific policy tools to reduce misallocation and quantifying their aggregate impacts\nproves challenging ( Hsieh and Klenow ,2009;Bartelsman et al. ,2013;Restuccia and Roger-\nson,2017;David and Venkateswaran ,2019;Baqaee and Farhi ,2020;Sraer and Thesmar ,\n2018). In a related paper, Bau and Matray (2023) shows that FDI liberalization in India can\nreduce misallocation across manufacturing firms. We contribute to this literature by causally\nexamining the effects of banks on the misallocation of resources and talent, both empirically\nand theoretically, leveraging a rare natural experiment in India\u2019s banking system.\nThe rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces the policy and our\nidentification strategy. Section 3 outlines the data that we use in our analysis. Section 4\npresents our findings on industrial growth and provides a theoretical framework explaining\nthe mechanism behind the results observed. In Section 5, we present our main results on\nstructural transformation. We conclude with Section 6.\n2 Policy Reform and Identification Strategy\n2.1 Policy and Institutional Background\nThe policy reform we analyze in this study was introduced in 2005 by the Reserve Bank\nof India (RBI) to incentivize banks to open more branches in under-served locations.5As\nper the policy, banks are required to submit an annual branch expansion plan to the RBI,\noutlining proposed branch openings, closings, and shifts. Thus, by proposing to open more\nbranches in areas that the RBI has designated as \u201cunder-banked,\u201d banks can increase their\nchances of obtaining licenses for their preferred locations.6 7\nThe definition of an \u201cunder-banked\u201d district is crucial for our identification strategy.\n5In India, the banking sector does not permit free entry of banks or bank branches. Banks are required\nto apply for and acquire licenses from the RBI prior to opening any new branch. Additionally, banks must\nalso request approval to close or relocate branches in most markets.\n6To make their license-issuance decisions, the RBI also evaluates banks based on other factors, such as\nthe bank\u2019s provision of \u201cno-frills\u201d accounts, adherence to priority sector lending obligations, and complaint\nresolution record. However, these requirements are applied at the bank level, not the individual branch level.\nFor more details on the reform, refer to the 2005 issue of the RBI\u2019s Master Circular on Branch Authorization .\n7Banks in India are not allowed to relocate their branches if they leave a market \u201cunbanked\u201d. Therefore,\nit is not possible for banks to circumvent this policy by opening in under-banked districts and then relocating\nto bank-rich areas.\n5According to the rule adopted by the RBI, a district is considered under-banked if the average\nnumber of people per bank branch (i.e., the population-to-branch ratio) exceeds the national\naverage for India8as follows:\nPopulation Dist.\n#Bank Branches Dist.|{z}\n\u201cUnder \u2212banked District \u201d>Population National\n#Bank Branches National|{z}\n\u201cNational Average \u201d\nIn September 2005, RBI published the list of \u201cunder-banked\u201d districts following the above\nrule, which was then slightly revised in 2006. It is important to note that the RBI did not\nadjust the list to account for changes in the ratio , despite more bank branches having entered\ninto under-banked districts. As a result, the list of \u201cunder-banked\u201d districts remained nearly\nconstant throughout our sample period.9Using the o\ufb00icial RBI document in 2006, we define\n375outof593districtsas\u201cunder-banked\u201ddistricts,whichwerespatiallydispersedthroughout\nthe country.\n2.2 Policy Cutoff and Identification Strategy\nThe arbitrary policy cutoff begets a regression discontinuity (RD) design that compares\nunder-banked districts (treatment group) and control districts with a population-to-branch\nratio just above and below the national average. The identification assumption is that dis-\ntricts close to the cutoff are similar in the absence of bank expansion. In this subsection,\nwe show that the policy provides exogenous variation in the presence of bank branches and\nvalidate our identification strategy. We will further explain our estimating equations along\nwith corresponding results in Section 4and Section 5to avoid confusion.\nTo validate this design, we first show that there is no evidence of manipulation of the\ncutoff\u2014sodistrictsdonotselectintotreatmentorcontrolgroups. TheleftpanelofFigure B.1\npresents the histogram plot and non-parametric fitted lines of districts\u2019 population-branch\nratios (relative to the national average). Visually, there is no sign of bunching on either side\nof the cutoff, suggesting limited scope of selection. We formally test it using the McCrary\n8According to RBI\u2019s Report of the Group to Review Branch Authorization Policy published in 2009,\nthe term \u201cnational average\u201d refers to a specific statistic provided directly by the RBI. However, the precise\nmethodology that the RBI used to compute this statistic is not explicitly disclosed. To account for this, we\nindependently recalculated this ratio based on its definition, and we validate the accuracy of our calculations\nin a subsequent section.\n9While the RBI only published the list of under-banked districts without revealing the detailed district-\nlevel population-branch ratios, we reconstruct the ratios using the 2001 population census data and bank\nbranchdata from the RBI. After 2010, certain states were made ineligible for \u201cunder-banked\u201d status, reducing\nthe number of \u201cunder-banked\u201d districts, but no new district was introduced to \u201cunder-banked\u201d status. The\nlist of \u201cunder-banked\u201d districts was thoroughly updated in 2014 using the 2011 population census data.\n6(2008) density test\u2014the McCrary estimator is -0.065 and the p-value is 0.95. Hence, we\ncannot reject smoothness around the cutoff.10\nThe right panel of Figure B.1confirms that the cutoff is indeed meaningful\u2014there is a\njump in under-banked status below and above the cutoff. The compliance with the assign-\nment rule is not perfect. Out of 578 districts that we have bank branch data, seven districts\nhad a status different than predicted by the population-branch ratio. Several reasons might\nexplain the imperfect compliance. First, there may be measurement error present within the\nbranch data.11Second, the RBI might have used their discretion to edit the list, potentially\nwith the intent to \u201chelp\u201d specific districts, or were captured by political elites. Fortunately,\nnon-compliance does not pose a threat to our analysis, as only 1.7% of observations in our\nASI establishment data belong to non-compliant districts. In our main analysis, we exclude\nnon-compliersanduseasharpRDdesign, assumingperfectcompliance. Wealsodemonstrate\nthe robustness of our results by including these observations in a Fuzzy RD design.\nWe further validate our RD design by showing that other covariates and pre-treatment\nvariables are smooth around the cutoff. Using the 2001 population census data, RBI\u2019s bank\nbranchdatain2004, andnighttimelightintensityin2004, Figure B.2a-dvisuallydemonstrate\nthat those district-level characteristics are continuous around the cutoff. We further test\nfor the smoothness of firm-level outcomes in 2004 using the Annual Survey of Industries\ndata. Figure B.2e-hshow that firms in treatment and control districts are similar in sales,\nfixed assets, number of employees, and marginal revenue product of capital prior to policy\nimplementation. Taken together, these results suggest that districts are properly randomized\n10The lack of manipulation is not surprising as the banking system in India is tightly regulated. By\nthe 1949 Banking Regulation Act , banks should submit an detailed annual expansion proposal and cannot,\nwithout the prior approval of the RBI, open a new place of business or change the location of the existing\nplace of business. Recall that the population-branch ratio has two components: 1) the district population\nin 2001, which was fixed when the expansion policy was announced; and 2) the number of bank branches in\nthe district. To game the policy, banks need to collectively gain RBI\u2019s approval to open or close branches\nat least one year before the policy. It is highly unlikely, as the policy was announced in 2005 without prior\nnotice.\n11The total number of districts in 2001 was 593. For districts that were split from a 2001 district, we\nrecoded them to the original district. Some districts were excluded because they were formed after 2001 by\nmerging several existing districts, making it impossible to map them to previous districts. After a careful\nreview of RBI documents and historical texts, we further excluded three districts due to suspected coding\nerrors or manipulation. Ujjain, a historically wealthy city not initially included in the list of under-banked\ndistricts in 2005, was added in 2006. We suspect this addition might have been politically motivated, and\nhence, we excluded Ujjain. Badgam district was also removed from our sample. There was a transfer of\nlead bank responsibility in respect of Anantnag, Budgam, Pulwama and Srinagar districts to the Jammu &\nKashmir Bank Ltd. up to March 2005. Despite the extension of the existing arrangement until March 31,\n2007, these bank branches were recorded as closed in the RBI bank branch data, reversing the treatment\nstatus of Badgam. Lastly, we dropped Varanasi due to the 2002 merger of the private sector Banaras State\nBank with the nationalized Bank of Baroda. This merger led to some bank branches in Varanasi being coded\nas closed, altering their treatment status.\n7around the cutoff, lending support to the causal interpretation of our RDD results.\nThe reform was highly effective by introducing powerful incentives for banks to open in\ndistricts previously considered unprofitable and thus under-banked, by leveraging licenses in\nhigh-profit areas.12Cramer(2021) andYoung(2017) have also examined this policy and\nshowed that commercial, especially private sector banks, strongly respond to the policy, as\nwe confirm in Figure B.3andB.4. On average, treatment districts received 21% more branch\nlicenses and 19% more branches than control districts by 2010, which corresponds to an\nincrease to 8.31 branches per 100,000 people, compared to the control mean of 6.99 branches\n(Cramer,2021). Furthermore, treatment districts also saw a large increase in deposit and\ncredit after the policy.13\n3 Data\nOur primary source of data is the establishment-level data from the Annual Survey of Indus-\ntries (ASI) from 1998 to 2013.14The ASI provides a representative sample of all registered\nmanufacturing establishments in India, with large establishments covered yearly and smaller\nestablishments surveyed on a sampling basis. The publicly available ASI includes unique\nplant identifiers that are consistent across the years starting from 1998. However, it lacks\ndistrict information, which is critical to our analysis. To address this, following Martin et\nal.(2017), we match the panel version of ASI with an older cross-sectional version, which\ncontains district identifiers until 2009, based on time-invariant factors and open/close vari-\nables.15The ASI includes comprehensive plant-level information on revenues, labor costs,\nstock of fixed assets, and materials, among others, which are essential for constructing our\nkey firm outcome variables. We perform substantial data cleaning and deflate all nominal\noutcome variables to constant 2004-2005 Rupee following Allcott et al. (2016).\nOur labor market data come from the Socioeconomic High-resolution Rural-Urban Geo-\ngraphic Dataset (SHRUG),16which integrates data from multiple rounds of the population\n12This kind of \u201cbundling\u201d policy requires high demand for branches in \u201crich\u201d areas, which is ensured by\nIndia\u2019s fast economic growth beginning in 2003 and continuing through the decade.\n13The increase in deposit and credit is especially pronounced for private sector banks, as depicted in Figure\nB.3. One concern is that private banks might simply \u201csteal\u201d market share from existing public sector banks,\nwhich could lead to minimal aggregate effects in local markets. However, our results in Figure B.4suggest\nthat although the stealing effect might be possible, its effects tend to be small and insignificant.\n14The reporting period for the ASI is the Indian fiscal year, which begins on April 1 and ends on March\n31. Throughout the paper, when we refer to a survey year, we use the calendar year in which the fiscal year\ncommences. All financial amounts are expressed in 2004 Rupees.\n15Since the ASI does not provide district identifiers after 2009, we use the panel structure of our data to\ninfer the district information for a subset of firms (approximately 2/3) that appear in the data before 2010.\n16Asher and Novosad (2020) provides details of the data construction, accessible at\n8and economic census. In particular, we use the 2001 and 2011 village-level Population Census\ndata from the Primary Census Abstract and Village Directory tables. This data provides in-\nformation on village infrastructure, demographics, employment, occupation, and population,\nwhich are used to construct variables related to labor supply in agricultural and manufactur-\ning & service sectors. It also provides a basis for connecting all other datasets at the village\nlevel. We complement this with crop suitability data from the FAO Global Agro-Ecological\nZones (GAEZ). This dataset assesses crop suitability and production potentialbased on plant\ncharacteristics, climate, and soil quality, aggregated to the village level by SHRUG.\nData pertaining to the banking sector and the implementation of the policy is obtained\nfrom the Reserve Bank of India. The list of under-banked districts is digitized from the report\nof RBI in 2006. While the exact district-level population-branch ratios are not included in\nthe report, we are able to reconstruct them using the 2001 population census data and bank\nbranch data from the Master O\ufb00ice File published by the RBI. We also obtain district-\nby-bank-group level credit and deposit data from 2003 to 2016 from the RBI. Since the\nlist of under-banked districts is based on the 2001 population census districts (and remains\nunchanged until 2014, when the list was updated according to the 2011 population census),\nwe build a crosswalk to map all data to the 2001 population census districts.17\n4 Did Bank Expansion Lead to Industrial Growth?\nIn this section, we conduct a comprehensive examination of the effects of bank expansion\non manufacturing firms. Starting with a visual exploration of time-series plots using raw\ndata from the ASI, we identify key trends and variations in total capital and firm size across\nunder-banked and control districts. Guided by these initial findings and the existing litera-\nture, we then develop a simple theoretical framework of heterogeneous firms under financial\nconstraints, which provides a conceptual roadmap for our empirical investigation. Subse-\nquently, we detail our identification strategy, employing a Difference-in-Discontinuity design\nthat leverages the policy cutoff and its implementation timeline to isolate the causal effects\nof bank expansion. Finally, we present our empirical findings at the firm and district levels,\nproviding insights into the micro and macro impacts of bank expansion on firm dynamics,\nlabor allocation, and industrial growth.\nhttps://www.devdatalab.org/shrug .\n17The district borders in India are very volatile. There were 593 districts in 2001 and 640 districts in 2011.\n94.1 Firms in Under-banked and Banked Districts: Time T rends\nT otal Capital. Figure1displays the time trends of total capital in all under-banked and\nbanked districts (left panel), and focusing exclusively on districts around the policy cutoff\n(right panel). Total capital is constructed as the weighted sum of firm-level fixed assets18in\nthe treatment and control groups, using the survey sampling weights. Capital is deflated to\nconstant 2004-2005 Rupee values using the Gross Capital Formation data from the RBI.\n(a) All distircts\n (b) Districts around the policy cutoff\nFigure 1: Trends of Total Fixed Assets in Treatment and Control Districts\nThe left panel reveals that under-banked districts had approximately 25% less capital\nthan banked districts. This gap remained stable despite rapid industrial growth from 2000\nto 2005. Under-banked districts began to catch up following the policy implementation\nas new bank branches entered and more credit was issued. This catch-up is more evident\nwhen focusing on districts around the policy cutoff, as displayed in the right panel. Under-\nbanked and banked districts had remarkably similar levels of capital prior to the policy,\nsuggesting that the treatment status assignment was as good as random around the policy\ncutoff. This further validates our RD design. However, divergence began as under-banked\ndistricts received more bank branches.\nA verage Firm Size. These patterns interestingly invert when examining the capital of\nthe average firm in Figure 2. The left panel suggests that before the policy, firms in under-\nbanked districts were approximately 20% largerthan firms in banked districts in terms of\nfixed assets.\nThere are two potential explanations. Firstly, the lack of access to finance might cause\nhigh costs of operation, such as a fixed cost of using credit, as posited by Ji et al. (2023).\n18Fixed assets include tangible assets such as plants, land, and machinery owned by firms, but exclude\nmining rights and other intangible assets.\n10Consequently, only the more productive and talented entrepreneurs would bear the costs\nand enter the market.19In this case, we would expect that opening more bank branches in\nunder-banked districts could lower the operating costs, promoting the entry of smaller (and\npossibly less productive) firms ( Bazzi et al. ,2021), thereby reducing the average firm size.\nAlternatively, the larger average firm size and the scarcity of bank branches could both\nbe the resultof ine\ufb00icient industrial policies or other structural barriers. Suppose firms in\nunder-banked districts are less profitable due to other ine\ufb00icient policies or barriers, then\nonly a few talented entrepreneurs enter and stay in the market. The aggregate demand for\ncredit is suppressed if firms choose to operate on a smaller scale or not enter the market\nin the first place. This muted credit demand could then discourage the entry of banks into\nthese districts, rendering them \u201cunder-banked\u201d. In this scenario, simply opening more bank\nbranches might not improve the situation by promoting the entry of potential entrepreneurs.\n(a) All distircts\n (b) Districts around the policy cutoff\nFigure 2: Trends of Firm Average Fixed Assets in Treatment and Control Districts\nProceeding to the post-2006 time-series, both panels indicate that firms in under-banked\ndistrictsgrewevenlargerfollowingthepolicy, aligningmorewiththesecondhypothesis. This\noutcome yields two critical insights. Firstly, despite firms in under-banked districts being\npositively sorted and consequently larger than their counterparts in banked districts, they\nremain too small due to financial constraints. Secondly, bank expansion seems to alleviate\nthese constraints more substantially along the intensive margin than the extensive one. As\na result, the reform appears to have primarily driven the growth of incumbent firms rather\nthan fostering the entry of potential entrants.\n19The intuition is similar in spirit to the heterogeneous firm model in Melitz(2003) that a fixed export\ncost will induce only the more productive firms to enter the export market.\n114.2 Bank Expansion and Firm Dynamics: A F ramework\nSetup. Now, we show a simple framework to illustrate the forces behind the expansion\nof banks and firm dynamics. In this framework, we consider an economy composed of M\ndistricts, each characterized by varying capital-market conditions that result in different\nfinancial constraints. Each district mis populated by a continuum of residents Lm, and wage\nrates wmclear the local labor market. For now we assume that each district is a closed\neconomy.\nHouseholds in each district are endowed with personal wealth cand an entrepreneurial\nidea, represented by the productivity parameter z. Households have a choice to be en-\ntrepreneurs or workers. If they choose to be workers, they supply one unit of labor inelasti-\ncally and earn the local labor wage wm. If a household with a productivity zchooses to be\nan entrepreneur, the production function is given by\ny=zk\u03b1l\u03b2(1)\nwhere kis the capital, and lis labor employed by the entrepreneur with an idea z.\u03b1+\u03b2 <1\nsuch that \u03b1, \u03b2\u2208(0,1), ensuring diminishing returns to scale. Assume all firms pay the same\nnational interest rate, r. For simplicity, we assume that firms produce a homogeneous final\nconsumption product, which is used as the numeraire.20We can solve the optimal kandl\nusing the first order conditions.\nk= \n1\nz\u0012\u03b1wm\n\u03b2r\u0013\u03b2r\n\u03b1! 1\n\u03b1+\u03b2\u22121\n(2)\nl= \n1\nz\u0012\u03b2r\n\u03b1wm\u0013\u03b1wm\n\u03b2! 1\n\u03b1+\u03b2\u22121\n(3)\nFirm Entry Condition. We introduce an overhead cost fmthat firms must pay to pro-\nduce, which could represent regulatory burdens or a fixed cost of borrowing. fmin district m\ncould be greater because of ine\ufb00icient industrial regulations or the scarcity of bank branches.\nThe net profit is thus \u03c0(z) =y\u2212rk\u2212wml\u2212fm. A household with an idea zbecomes an\nentrepreneur if \u03c0(z)\u2265wm. Note that we can write \u03c0(z)in terms of wage bills such that\n\u03c0(z) =(1\u2212\u03b1\u2212\u03b2)wml\n\u03b2\u2212fm. Substituting Equation 3into the firm entry condition gives the lower\n20All the results hold if we assume a CES demand function and firms produce differentiated products as\ninBazzi et al.

This threshold decreases when firms are subject to smaller overhead costs,\ni.e., when fmis low. With lower overhead costs, households become more willing to under-\ntake entrepreneurship, even at lower productivity levels, which in turn reduces the average\nproductivity across all incumbent firms.\nAt the same time, there is a general equilibrium effect at work. The entry of additional\nentrepreneurs elevates the overall demand for labor at the district level, which in turn pushes\nup local wages and reduces the optimal firm size across all productivity levels. Consequently,\ndistricts with a lower fmtend to have a smaller firm size. This is due to two factors: the\ninflux of smaller firms and the increase in equilibrium wages.\nFigure3illustrates the pre-reform correlations between district-level Total Factor Pro-\nductivity (TFP), wages, and the population-to-branch ratio.21Notably, districts with higher\npopulation-to-branch ratios (indicating fewer banks) tend to exhibit higher TFP and lower\nwages. Figure B.6shows that these districts also have fewer entrants and a smaller number\nof plants. These patterns align with our interpretation that such districts are characterized\nby a higher overhead cost, or fm.22\n21District-level TFP is measured by the average Solow residuals across all firms in the district, using the\nsampling weights. Year fixed effects are projected out. In our analysis, we effectively assume that all district-\nlevel TFP heterogeneity originates from variations in the productivity threshold z, rather than district-\nspecific productivity parameters or differing talent distributions across districts. One testable prediction of\nour model is that these variations in zinfluence district TFP by altering the lower tail of the firm productivity\ndistribution, while the upper tail remains constant across districts, assuming a Pareto distribution of firm\nproductivity. To test this prediction, we categorize districts based on their aggregate TFP into High-TFP\nand Low-TFP groups (those above and below the median aggregate TFP, respectively). For each group,\nwe depict the cumulative distribution of firm-specific TFP, conditional on their TFP surpassing the 90th\npercentile in the overall distribution. Figure B.5demonstrates that the two distributions (truncated at the\n90th percentile) are strikingly similar, confirming our model\u2019s implication that heterogeneity in district TFP\nis driven by variations of z.\n22An alternate method models fmas a fixed entry cost, a price that entrants must pay prior to the\nproductivity draw, following the tradition of Hopenhayn (1992). An implication of this model is that higher\nentry costs deter entry, resulting in fewer entrants willing to pay the sunk cost to receive productivity\ndraws. Consequently, wages drop due to decreased demand for labor, and the productivity threshold reduces.\nHowever, according to this model, districts with higher entry costs should have lower average TFP, which\ncontradicts the evidence depicted in Figure 3.\n13(a) log(TFP)\n (b) log(Wage)\nFigure 3: District-Average TFP, Wage, and Population-Branch Ratio\nDoes Limited Bank Access Cause High Overhead Costs? While a high fmcan lead\nto larger firm size in under-banked districts, it is uncertain whether this is driven by the\nscarcity of banks. Suppose the overhead cost fmprimarily consists of a fixed cost of using\ncredit, and firms in under-banked districts must pay a higher fmdue to limited access to\nbanking services.23This credit entry cost may capture, for example, both transportation\nand information costs, and we make a reduced-form assumption that it is decreasing in the\nnumber of branches in a district as in Ji et al.(2023). In this case, we would expect that by\nopeningmorebranchesinunder-bankeddistricts, thebankexpansionpolicyshould, intheory,\nbring down the average firm size in treated districts by lowering fmand allowing smaller (and\nless productive) firms to enter. However, this is inconsistent with our time-series evidence\nreported in Figure 2, demonstrating that the average capital actually increased following the\nreform.\nTherefore, the correlations highlighted in Figure 3could be spurious and not indicative\nof any real causal relationship. Districts with higher fm, potentially attributable to other\nine\ufb00icient policies, would have a higher productivity threshold z, resulting in a suppressed\ndemand for bothlabor and credit. This subdued credit demand could, in turn, deter bank\nentry, leading to a higher population-to-branch ratio. This line of reasoning prompts the\nquestion as to why the overhead cost, fm, might be higher in under-banked districts, given\nthat the scarcity of banks alone cannot explain it. Previous research has shed light on various\nindustrial policies that could potentially contribute to ine\ufb00iciently high overhead costs and\nentry barriers. These include policies such as priority sector lending ( Banerjee and Duflo ,\n23We do not model the borrowing decision here, implicitly assuming that all firms borrow and pay the\ncost. This could be the case if the optimal level of capital kfor all existing firms is large relative to their\ninitial wealth endowment c. It is consistent with the data that more than 85% of ASI firms in our sample\nreported having positive outstanding loans even before the reform was implemented.\n142014), restrictions on Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) ( Bau and Matray ,2023), contractual\nfrictions ( Bertrand et al. ,2021), and reservations for Small-Scale Industries ( Martin et al. ,\n2017).\nBorrowing Constraint. To account for the post-reform increase in the average firm size,\nwe explore an alternative approach to model credit frictions. This approach posits a bor-\nrowing constraint that limits the maximum amount of credit firms can borrow, drawing\nfrom the frameworks presented by Evans and Jovanovic (1989) andBazzi et al. (2021). An\nentrepreneur is a net borrower if the optimal level of capital exceeds her initial wealth en-\ndowment c, and she can borrow at most (\u03bbm\u22121)c, with \u03bbm>1. This borrowing constraint\nthus places an upper bound on the capital stock such that 0\u2264k\u2264\u03bbmc.\nThe borrowing constraint is binding if the unconstrained optimal capital in Equation 2\nis greater than \u03bbmc, and the firm uses capital at the upper bound. A firm is financially\nconstrained if\nz\u2265(\u03bbmc)1\u2212\u03b1\u2212\u03b2\u0012\u03b1wm\n\u03b2r\u0013\u03b2r\n\u03b1\u2261zuc (5)\nIn the (z, c)space, potential entrepreneurs are constrained if they are relatively talented but\ndo not have enough wealth to borrow to the optimal level. Financially constrained firms,\nconditional on choosing entrepreneurship, use the following optimal capital and labor.\nkc=\u03bbmc (6)\nlc= \n1\nz\u00121\n\u03bbmc\u0013\u03b1wm\n\u03b2!1\n\u03b2\u22121\n(7)\nWe can readily observe that kcandlcincrease with c, implying that constrained firms are\nsmaller than their unconstrained peers with the same level of productivity. In addition,\nconstrained firms have a lower capital-labor ratio. Our firm entry condition ( 4) still applies\nto unconstrained firms, but constrained ones have a higher productivity threshold. They\nenter if constrained profit \u03c0(z, c) =(1\u2212\u03b2)wmlc\n\u03b2\u2212r\u03bbmc\u2212fm\u2265wm.

Appendix A.1shows\nthat zcis decreasing in cif and only if the unconstrained optimal capital kis strictly greater\nthan the borrowing constraint \u03bbmc; in other words, when firms are strictly financially con-\n15strained. Intuitively, a constrained entrepreneur with productivity zis more likely to enter\nif he or she has a higher level of wealth c. The constrained threshold is always higher than\nthe unconstrained threshold, but decreases with cuntil it reaches the level for unconstrained\nentrepreneurs.\nThe left panel of Figure 4plots firms\u2019 entry conditions and the financial constraint condi-\ntion in the (z, c)space. The horizontal line represents the unconstrained threshold z, which\nis independent of wealth and \u03bbm. The dotted blue curve maps the financial constraint condi-\ntionzucfrom Equation 5; households above this curve are financially constrained. The solid\nblue curve shows the constrained threshold zc, which decreases in c. All three curves meet\nat(z, c). Households below either zcorzopt for employment over entrepreneurship.

We now discuss how relaxing the bor-\nrowing constraint (by increasing \u03bbm) affects firm dynamics. In the partial equilibrium, fi-\nnancially constrained firms strongly respond to the increase in \u03bbmby increasing their capital\nstock and labor. The size of incumbent firms would therefore increase.\nIn terms of entry and exit, while changes in \u03bbmdo not directly affect the unconstrained\nthreshold productivity z, a higher \u03bbmcan still lead to more unconstrained entry by raising\nthe financial constraint threshold zucin Equation ( 5). Intuitively, there is initially a set of\nfinancially constrained entrepreneurs ( z > z uc) that find it unprofitable to enter, if z < z c.\nWhen \u03bbincreases, they might choose to enter if they are no longer financially constrained\nand have a z > z.\n16For constrained entrepreneurs, relaxing the borrowing constraint directly increases their\nentry, as shown by Appendix A.1that zcis decreasing in \u03bbm. The right panel of Figure 4\nillustrates the impact of easing the borrowing constraint on firm entry in partial equilibrium\n(assuming local wages remain unchanged). When the borrowing constraint moves from \u03bb0\nto\u03bb1, both the financial constraint line zucand the constrained threshold zcshift leftward,\nshown by the blue curves. The blue-shaded region indicates the mass of entrants. Note that\nthe average productivity and size of new entrants, both constrained and unconstrained ones,\nmay not necessarily be lower than those of incumbents. This is because the entrants are\non the margins of the borrowing constraint and the constrained entry threshold, which are\nhigher than the unconstrained threshold. The average productivity and size of entrants are\ndetermined by the joint distribution of productivity and initial wealth endowment (z, c).\nInteraction between fm and \u03bbm.In this framework, the overhead cost, fm, interacts\nwith the borrowing constraint \u03bbmin a way that impacts entrepreneurial entry. In districts\nwith a high fm, both the constrained ( z) and unconstrained productivity thresholds ( zc)\nwould be higher, resulting in a smaller mass of potential entrepreneurs on the margin of\nentry. Consequently, a relaxation of the borrowing constraint (with an increase in \u03bbm) would\ntrigger fewer entries in districts with a higher fmwhen the entry thresholds are in the tail\nof the productivity distribution. The simulations reported in the left panel of Figure 5lend\nsupport to this observation. These simulations depict how the mass of entries, emerging\nfrom halving the borrowing constraint, varies with different levels of overhead costs (with the\nbaseline mass of entry normalized to 1 when fm= 0.4). It is particularly noteworthy that\nas the overhead cost increases from 0.4 to 2, there is a 25% decline in the rate of firm entry,\nunderscoring the sensitivity of new business formation to the overhead costs in the market.\nThe intuition is straightforward: with a high overhead cost, even a less stringent borrowing\nconstraint does not significantly improve the prospects for potential entrepreneurs.\nIn contrast, the right panel of Figure 5illustrates that incumbent firms in districts with\na higher overhead cost tend to increase their capital more when the borrowing constraint is\nrelaxed to the same degree. Yet, firm expansion is less affected by overhead costs\u2014there is\na mere 5% larger expansion in capital in districts with higher overhead costs compared to\nthose with lower overhead costs, with the latter\u2019s value normalized to 1. This highlights an\nimportant interaction between the financial constraints faced by potential entrepreneurs and\nthe overhead costs inherent to the business environment of a district.\n17(a) Firm Entry\n (b) Firm Expansion\nFigure 5: Effect of Easing Borrowing Constraint on Firm Entry and Expansion against fm\nNote.The figure illustrates the relationship between district-level overhead costs fm, ranging from 0.4 to 2,\nthe mass of entrants (left panel), and the change in firm capital size (right panel), induced by a relaxation\nof the borrowing constraint, \u03bbm, increasing from 1.5to3. For each given fm, we sample 105(z, c)from a\nbi-variate Pareto distribution (a= 1.5, \u03b81= 0.01, \u03b82= 0.01), and calculate the mass of entrants and change\nin firm capital size. We repeat this procedure 1000 times and use the average values.\nGeneral Equilibrium Effects. Beyond the direct effects on firm expansion and entry,\nrelaxing the borrowing constraint also has several important general equilibrium effects on\nlocal labor markets. Both the expansion of constrained incumbent firms and new entrants\nraise labor demand and bid up local wage wm, as determined by the labor market clearing\ncondition:\nZ\ncZ\u221e\nmax{zc,zuc}lc(wm, \u03bbm)dF(z, c) +Z\u221e\ncZzuc\nzl(wm)dF(z, c)\n=Z\ncZ\nz1{max{\u03c0(wm), \u03c0c(\u03bbm, wm)}< w m}dF(z, c) (9)\ncis the level of wealth such that the financial constraint condition ( 5) intersects with the\nunconstrained threshold zat(z, c).24The first term represents the total labor demand from\nconstrained firms, which increases with \u03bbmdue to higher lcand lower zc. The second term is\nthe total labor demand from unconstrained firms, which also increases because a higher \u03bbm\nallows for more unconstrained entry, as discussed above.25The right-hand side represents\n24It is straightforward to confirm that (z, c)is also the intersection of the financial constraint condition\n(5) with the constrained ( 8) threshold.\n25Theoretically, a very large increase in \u03bbmcould lead to a decrease in the total employment within con-\nstrainedfirmsifmanyconstrainedfirmstransitiontoanunconstrainedstatus. However, thetotalemployment\nacross both constrained and unconstrained firms would still increase with \u03bbm.\n18the mass of households who choose to be workers over entrepreneurs. As \u03bbmincreases, wm\nmust increase to maintain equality, which could partially offset the expansion of constrained\nfirms.\nA higher wmraises both constrained ( zc) and unconstrained ( z) productivity thresh-\nolds following Equations ( 8) and (4), thus elevating the exit rate. Intuitively, marginal\nentrepreneurs are more likely to exit due to lower profits and a higher local wage. It is\nimportant to note that \u03bbmhas no direct effect on the unconstrained threshold z, so uncon-\nstrained firms have an unambiguously higher exit rate following an increase in \u03bbm, especially\nfor those on the margin (firms that are smaller and less productive). The neteffect on the\nconstrained threshold zcis ambiguous and depends on the relative strength of the GE effects.\nExtensions. In this simple framework, we do not consider rural-to-urban or cross-district\nmigration, instead assuming an exogenous urban labor supply. We hope to relax these\nassumptions in a future version of the model by endogenizing sectoral labor supply and cross-\ndistrict migration. In the subsequent section we will show empirical results that suggest that\nthe natural experiment had an important and sizeable effect on rural-to-urban migration.\nWe can also extend our framework by incorporating endogenous innovation, in the spirit of\nKlette and Kortum (2004). We hope to allow for firms in the model to produce multiple\nproducts, in line with empirical results we will show in this section on the effect of bank\nexpansion on product innovation.\nSummary . Our simple framework offers insights on firm dynamics in the presence of bor-\nrowing constraints and overhead costs. The model shows that while we need a high overhead\ncost to rationalize the larger firm size and a smaller number of firms in under-banked dis-\ntricts, the overhead cost cannot be primarily driven by the scarcity of bank branches, which\ncan hardly explain why firm size grew further following the reform. Assuming a borrowing\nconstraint dependent on the number of bank branches, the model predicts that relaxing fi-\nnancial constraints would lead to the expansion of constrained firms and the exit of smaller\nunconstrained firms as the unconstrained threshold zincreases. The neteffect on firm entry\nis ambiguous and depends on the relative strength of the direct effect and the GE effects\nthrough local wages. However, in the presence of migration constraints and a relatively in-\nelastic labor supply, the GE effect might outweigh the direct effect and potentially mitigate\nentry. Therefore, following the reform, the average firm size in under-banked districts could\nbecome even larger, if the effects on entry are more muted and the exit rate increases. We\nwill test these predictions in the next subsection.\n194.3 Estimating Equation: Difference-in-Discontinuity\nIn this subsection, we test several key predictions of the model by estimating the treatment\neffects of bank expansion on average firm size, entry, and exit. In addition, we will also\nexamine the aggregate effects at the district level. To capture the dynamic effects as depicted\nin Figure 1and2, we employ the Difference-in-Discontinuity design, following Grembi et al.\n(2016). Intuitively, this approach first compares firms in treatment versus control districts\nwith a population-per-branch ratio close to the cutoff, as in the standard RD design. Then\nwe compare this discontinuity around the cutoff before and after the policy. Importantly, we\ncontrol for district fixed-effects in our baseline regression and only use with-district variation\nin the timing of the policy.\nTo estimate the treatment effect of the bank expansion policy on firms, we have the\nfollowing equation:\nyidt=\u03b21UnderBank d+\u03b22Ratio d+\u03b23UnderBank d\u2217Ratio d\n+Post 2006\u2217(\u03b41UnderBank d+\u03b42Ratio d+\u03b43UnderBank d\u2217Ratio d)\n+\u03c3d+\u03c3t+Xidt+\u03b5itd\ns.t.\u2212h < Ratio d< h\nwhere yidtincludes outcome variables of firm iin district din year t. The first three terms\non the right-hand side comprise the standard RD design with the running variable Ratio d\u2014\nthe population-branch-ratio of district d. By fitting a first-order polynomial of the running\nvariable on both sides of the cutoff, \u03b21captures the effect of being in treated districts on\nthe outcome variable yidt. The next three terms in the second row are interacted with a\npost-policy dummy variable, allowing for variations in the discontinuity before and after the\npolicy. \u03b41thus captures the treatment effect of the bank expansion policy on firms.\nThe covariate Xidtincludes firm ownership fixed effects, an urban dummy variable, and\ndistrict characteristics (including district population and the number of bank branches), in-\nteracting with a linear time trend. \u03c3tand\u03c3dare year and district fixed effects, respectively.\nNotably, the main RD effects in the first row are absorbed by the district fixed effects.\nStandard errors are clustered at the district level to account for potential correlation within\ndistricts. The parameter his the MSE-optimal bandwidth, and only firms within this band-\nwidth are included in the sample. We conduct several robustness checks to confirm the\nconsistency of our results across different bandwidths.\nA similar empirical equation is used to estimate the treatment effect on district-level\naggregate capital, sales, and manufacturing employment. These outcome variables are con-\n20structed as the weighted sum of firm-level counterparts, using the sampling weights.\nThe assumption of our identification strategy is that firms in districts just below and just\nabove the national average follow a (local) parallel trend, akin to the standard Difference-in-\nDifference design. Note that this assumption is considerably weaker than the assumptions\nin the standard RD approach, which requires that all covariates should exhibit smoothness\naround the cutoff\u2014a feature we have validated for several key covariates in Figure B.2. Our\nidentification strategy merely requires that any discontinuities around the cutoff, resulting\nfrom any cause, remain unchanged in the absence of the policy\u2014an assertion we will validate\nin the following event study plot.\n4.4 Effects of Bank Expansion on Firms\nEvent study graphs. Figure1and2visually illustrate that the gaps in firms\u2019 fixed\nassets between under-banked and banked districts remain remarkably stable throughout the\npre-treatment period. Furthermore, they become indistinguishable from one another when\nwe focus on districts close to the policy cutoff. We can formally test the assumption of\n(local) parallel trend in event study graphs, by substituting the post-policy dummy with\nyear dummies in our estimating equation.\n-.50.511.5\n20002002200420062008201020122014Year\n(a) log(Fixed Assets)\n-.50.511.5\n20002002200420062008201020122014Year (b) log(Sales Revenue)\nFigure 6: Event Study Graphs for the Treatment Effects on Capital and Sales\nFigure6displays the event study graphs for capital and sales revenue. These graphs\nreport the yearly treatment effects of being situated in (near cutoff) treated districts relative\nto the controls, using the same controls and bandwidth as our baseline equation. The nonex-\nistence of a discernible effect prior to the reform provides visual evidence of the \u201cparallel\ntrends\u201d assumption, thereby validating our identification strategy.26FigureB.7reports sim-\n26A potential concern could be the migration of plants from control to treated districts, in anticipation\n21ilar patterns and corroborates the absence of pre-trends for wage bills and total employment.\nFollowing the bank expansion, firms in treated districts grow larger by using more capital\nand labor, and generating more revenues. These effects are both economically significant\nand unfold progressively over time, in line with the idea that changes in the allocation of\nresources are typically slow-moving. Meanwhile, it is worth noting that the adjustments in\nlabor appear to lag even further, likely due to other constraints in the labor markets, as\ndocumented by Bertrand et al. (2021).\nBaseline estimates. Table1presents the estimated treatment effects of the bank ex-\npansion policy on firm-level sales revenue, fixed assets, and wage bills using our baseline\nestimating equation. For the average firm, capital increases by 37% (column 2), indicating\nthat the policy exerts large positive effects on capital investments.27The higher capital in-\nvestment does not crowd out labor, as wage bills and employment increase by approximately\nthe same amount (columns 3-4), suggesting strong complementarity between capital and\nlabor. Post-reform, firms in treated districts expand their sales revenue by approximately\n30%.\nTable 1: Treatment Effect of Bank Expansion on Firms\n(1) (2) (3) (4)\nDependent V ariable Revenues Capital Wage Bill Employment\nTreated * Post 0.291** 0.371** 0.357*** 0.306***\n(0.142) (0.166) (0.133) (0.113)\nObservations 135,673 135,673 135,673 135,673\nR-squared 0.173 0.212 0.199 0.147\nDistrict FE Yes Yes Yes Yes\nYear FE Yes Yes Yes Yes\nFirm Controls Yes Yes Yes Yes\nDistrict Trends Yes Yes Yes Yes\nNotes: All outcome variables are in logs.

However, such a movement is implausible given India\u2019s stringent industrial\nregulation scheme. Evidence from our plant panel data from 1998 to 2013 indicates that less than 5% of all\nplants have ever relocated their districts. Note that this figure could be inflated due to possible measurement\nor coding errors in the district information. Our baseline analysis uses a plant\u2019s modal district as the time-\ninvariant district. Our results remain robust when plants that have relocated are excluded.\n27As shown in B.3, the increase in fixed assets is mostly driven by investments in buildings, plants, and\nmachinery, a\ufb00irming that firms use newly acquired credit to improve production capacity.\n22Robustness. TableB.1shows that the estimates are robust under the most parsimonious\nspecification, which includes only district and year fixed effects. As we demonstrate in Table\nB.2, our results are robust to the inclusion of 2-digit industry-by-year fixed effects. By\ncomparing firms in the same 2-digit industry in the same year, this specification accounts\nfor any unobserved, time-varying, sector-level shocks, such as aggregate trade shocks and\nchanges in the priority sector lending policies at the 2\u2013digit industry level.28In addition,\nto account for the possibility that some Indian states are more exposed to the reform and\nmay have adjusted their state-level banking regulations or been affected by other concurrent\nshocks, we flexibly control for any state-level time-varying unobserved shocks. Table B.2\nshows that our results are robust to the inclusion of state-by-year fixed effects. Moreover,\nFigureB.8andB.9demonstratethatourresultsholdrobustnesstodroppingindividualstates\nand 2-digit industries one by another. Figure B.10shows that using different bandwidths\ndoes not change our estimates qualitatively.\nOutstanding loans. One natural question is to what extent the growth of firms doc-\numented above is attributable to bank expansion alleviating credit market frictions. An\nalternative hypothesis is that bank expansion might stimulate local economic activity and\nconsumption, allowing firms to generate higher sales revenue, which they can reinvest. While\nwe ideally want to examine the treatment effect on loans that firms obtained directly from\nbanks, the ASI data only provides information on total outstanding loans without specify-\ning their sources. Nevertheless, we present the effect on total outstanding loans in Table\nB.4(column 1-3) and the event study graph in Figure B.7(panel (c)). Following the re-\nform, outstanding loans experienced a 41% increase (using our baseline equation in column\n1) for the average firm in treated districts.29The substantial increase in total outstanding\nloans suggests a real expansion in firm-level credit rather than a reorganization of existing\nliabilities\u2014using bank loans to replace other higher-interest debts. Notably, this point es-\ntimate aligns with the estimate for fixed assets, implying that the alleviation of borrowing\nconstraints can account for the entirety of the observed firm growth.\n28Allbanks(publicandprivate)arerequiredtolendatleast40%oftheirnetcredittothe\u201cprioritysector\u201d,\nwhichincludesagriculture, agriculturalprocessing, transportindustry, andsmallscaleindustry(SSI).Ifbanks\nfail to satisfy the priority sector target, they are required to lend money to specific government agencies at\nvery low interest rates ( Banerjee and Duflo ,2014). The definition of the priority sector has expanded over\ntime. There are 53 distinct 2-digit industries in our ASI data.\n29In our sample, more than 85% of firms reported having positive outstanding loans even before the\nreform. Considering that most firms had already accessed some form of loan, we did not observe a significant\neffect of bank expansion on the binary variable representing loan usage, as shown in Table B.4(column 4-6).\nHowever, it\u2019s crucial to highlight that this finding does not rule out the possibility that bank expansion could\nreduce the fixed costs of accessing credit. If credit usage is a prerequisite for market entry, we would expect\nall existing firms to borrow. In this scenario, a reduction in borrowing costs would not change the proportion\nof firms using loans; instead, it could lower entry barriers and alter the composition of the firm pool.\n23Product Scope. Another dimension to consider is that as households become richer, they\nmaydiversifytheirconsumptionportfoliobypurchasingmorevarietiesofproducts( Li,2021).\nThis increase in the demand for variety could encourage firms to expand their production\nby introducing new products. This discussion ties into a broader debate in growth theory\n(Garcia-Maciaetal. ,2019): dofirmsachievegrowththroughthecreationofnewproducts,the\nprocess of creative destruction, or by improving their existing products? If relaxing financial\nconstraints could lead to the improvement of existing products or the introduction of new\nproducts, the bank expansion reform could yield substantial dynamic gains by stimulating\ninnovation.\nWe can directly test the effects on product composition by leveraging a unique feature of\nthe ASI, which reports both total product sales and total quantity sold at the firm-product\nlevel, as mandated by the 1956 Companies Act.30With this information, we compute the\nestablishment-level total number of products, a price index constructed as the weighted\naverage of product prices, and indicators of product addition and deletion using the firm-\nproduct panel.\nTable 2: Treatment Effect of Bank Expansion on Product Portfolio\n(1) (2) (3) (4)\nDependent V ariable log(Product) log(Price) Add Product Del.

The muted effect on price\nalso alleviates another concern that our results might be driven by an increase in demand in\ntreateddistricts, whichshouldpushupoutputprices. Furthermore, columns3-4indicatethat\nfirms in treated districts are not more likely to add or delete products post-reform compared\nto their counterparts in control districts. Thus, the observed firm expansion is unlikely to be\ndriven by firms creating new products or stealing from others. Instead, the finding suggests\nfirms primarily grow by increasing the production of existing products, hinting at limited\ndynamic gains.\nFirm Entry and Exit. While we have demonstrated that the average firm in treated\ndistricts grew larger following the reform, it remains unclear whether it is driven by the\ngrowth of firms or changes in the composition of firms. Our framework predicts that bank\nexpansion would unambiguously lead to a higher exit rate among small firms, owing to the\nelevation of the unconstrained productivity threshold, z. However, the net effect on entry\nremains ambiguous, contingent upon the balance between the direct effect caused by a lower\nconstrained threshold, zc, and the general equilibrium effect attributed to increased local\nwages. The average firm size could potentially shrink post-reform if the entry rate surges\nsignificantly, even amidst the expansion of constrained firms.\nWe construct firm entry and exit indicators using our panel data, following the method-\nology of Harrison et al. (2015).31Both entry and exit rates in our sample are at 6.7%,32\nindicating that the economy is in a steady state. Table 3presents the treatment effects on\nfirm entry in Panel A and exit in Panel B. The first column reveals that the reform has\npositive but statistically insignificant effects on both entry and exit rates. This suggests that\nour observed firm expansion results are primarily driven by the growth of incumbent firms,\nrather than changes in the composition of firms.\nHowever, a closer examination reveals substantial variation across firm sizes. Column 2\npresents the heterogeneous treatment effects, in which our \u201cTreated*Post\u201d term is interacted\nwith a \u201cBig\u201d dummy variable, assigned as 1 if a firm\u2019s average employment surpasses the\nnational average.33The main \u201cTreated*Post\u201d term suggests an increase in the exit rate of\n31An entry is defined as a firm appearing in the data for the first time within three years of the initial\nproduction year. An exit is when a firm is o\ufb00icially declared \u201cclosed\u201d in the ASI and remains so.\n32The figures are consistent with the exit rate imputed from plant age cohorts by Hsieh and Klenow\n(2014), also using the ASI data.\n33We use the average establishment size over the years as a proxy for firm-level productivity. Given\nthat firms usually enter the market at a smaller size, and considering that some firms may already be on a\ndownward trajectory before their exit, we opt not to utilize the establishment size at the points of entry and\nexit. This \u201cBig\u201d dummy is interacted with all single and cross-terms in our baseline Difference-in-Difference\nspecification.\n25Table 3: Treatment Effect of Bank Expansion on Firm Entry and Exit\nPanel A : Entry\n(1) (2) (3) (4) (5)\nFull Sample Full Sample L\u2208(0,20) L\u2208[20,100) L >100\nTreated*Post 0.009 0.001 0.002 0.024 -0.001\n(0.010) (0.016) (0.018) (0.017) (0.010)\nTreated*Post*Big 0.009\n(0.021)\nObservations 166,094 166,094 51,623 52,553 61,917\nR-squared 0.047 0.054 0.062 0.054 0.032\nMean of dependent variable 0.0674 0.0674 0.0918 0.0867 0.0306\nPanel B : Exit\n(1) (2) (3) (4) (5)\nFull Sample Full Sample L\u2208(0,20) L\u2208[20,100) L >100\nTreated*Post 0.013 0.047** 0.069** 0.033 0.003\n(0.012) (0.022) (0.027) (0.025) (0.008)\nTreated*Post*Big -0.038*\n(0.020)\nObservations 166,094 166,094 51,623 52,553 61,917\nR-squared 0.027 0.045 0.053 0.040 0.021\nMean of dependent variable 0.0674 0.0674 0.101 0.0768 0.0314\nNotes: Entry equals 1 in the first year an establishment appears in the data within three years of the\ninitial production year.

All regressions include district and year fixed effects, firm controls, and district\ntrends. Big is a dummy variable equal to 1 if the establishment\u2019s average employment number is greater\nthan the national average. We interact this Big dummy with all the single and cross-term in our baseline\nDiff-in-Desc specification. Firm controls include firm ownership fixed effects and a dummy variable of\nbeing in urban areas. District trends include district population in 2001 and the number of bank branches\nin 1997, interacted with a linear time trend. Standard errors are clustered at the district level.\u2217p <0.05,\n\u2217\u2217p <0.01,\u2217\u2217\u2217p <0.001\nsmaller firms by 4.7 percentage points (approximately 70% of the sample mean). This aligns\nwith our theoretical framework, as the reform raises the exit rate among smaller firms due\nto the elevation of the unconstrained productivity threshold. Interestingly, this main effect\nis almost entirely offset by the interaction term, indicating that larger firms\u2019 exit rates are\nunaffected by the reform. Regarding firm entry, the reform also exerts a slightly larger,\n26albeit still insignificant, effect on the entry of larger firms, consistent with our model. To\nfurther validate our findings, we present additional results in columns 3-5 using the baseline\nDifference-in-Discontinuity specification, disaggregated by firm sizes. These results confirm\nthat the observed higher exit rate is mainly driven by very small firms (with fewer than 20\nemployees), while the effects on larger firms are small and insignificant.\nTFP .We conclude our firm-level analysis by noting that the reform had minimal effect\non firm productivity. We measure firm-level productivity (TFP) using two methods: (1)\ncalculating Solow residuals, and (2) estimating the revenue production function, following\nthe approach outlined by Levinsohn and Petrin (2003). Table B.5presents the effects on\nTFP using both measures. Interestingly, our results indicate that the reform has precisely\nestimated null effects on both measures of firm productivity. This finding aligns with our\nstatic model that abstracts from innovation and previous empirical results, indicating that\nincumbent firms grow by employing more resources to increase the production of existing\nproducts under the same technology. In comparison, changes in firm composition and inno-\nvation (including both product and process innovation) play a relatively insignificant role.\n4.5 District-level Aggregated Effect\nOur analyses above have shown that the average firm expands due to bank expansion. In this\nsubsection, we present district-level results to explore the aggregate effect of the reform on\nlocal markets, echoing our graphic evidence reported in Figure 1. Our district-level variables\nare constructed by aggregating the establishment-level variables, inflated by their sampling\nweights. We use the same bandwidth as in our plant-level analysis with the same estimating\nequation to ensure that we are comparing the same set of treatment and control districts.34\nTo further validate our empirical strategy, Figure B.11presents the event study plots for\ndistrict-level aggregate revenues, capital, wages, and employment. Consistent with the time-\nseries plots of total capital in Figure 1, treated districts did not experience faster industrial\ngrowth prior to the policy implementation, providing visual evidence that pre-trends cannot\nbias our estimates.\nTable4presents our Difference-in-Discontinuity results at the district level. Importantly,\nthese results align closely with the firm-level estimates reported in Table 1. The coe\ufb00i-\n34We replace our firm-level controls, including firm ownership fixed effects and an urban dummy variable,\nwith the district share of private firms and the share in urban areas. Some districts have very few firms in\nsome years and generate a significant amount of noise; hence, we drop district-years with less than 20 firms.\nDropping these observations does not change our estimates. In addition, we control for the number of plants\nin a district-year to account for the noise, which, again, does not change our estimates.\n27Table 4: Treatment Effect of Bank Expansion on District Aggregate\n(1) (2) (3) (4)\nDependent V ariable Revenue Capital Wage Bill Employment\nTreated * Post 0.385** 0.387*** 0.340* 0.308**\n(0.183) (0.136) (0.172) (0.126)\nObservations 1,838 1,838 1,838 1,838\nR-squared 0.960 0.935 0.972 0.969\nDistrict FE Yes Yes Yes Yes\nYear FE Yes Yes Yes Yes\nDistrict Trends Yes Yes Yes Yes\nNotes: All outcome variables are constructed as the weighted sum of firm-level\nvariables using the sampling weights and then transformed in logs.

Additionalcontrolsincludetheshareofprivatefirms,\nthe share in urban areas, and the number of firms in a district-year. Regressions are\nweighted by district-level capital size during the pre-reform period. District-year\nobservations with less than 10 plants are Dropped. Standard errors are clustered at\nthe district level.\u2217p <0.05,\u2217\u2217p <0.01,\u2217\u2217\u2217p <0.001\ncients suggest a significant industrial growth in districts that were narrowly under-banked\nprior to the reform. Post-reform, these treated districts saw a 39% surge in manufacturing\noutput, facilitated by a substantial increase in fixed assets (39%) and manufacturing labor\u2014\ndemonstrated by a 34% rise in wage bills (column 3) and a 31% growth in employment\n(column 4).\nThe remarkable consistency between the district-level aggregate results and the firm-\nlevel findings suggests that changes in firm composition have a negligible impact on the\nobserved trends. This is further supported by the insignificant effects on firm entry and exit\ndocumented in Table 3.\n5 Effects on Structural T ransformation\nSo far, we\u2019ve shown that manufacturing firms experienced significant expansion in treated\ndistricts following the reform. In this section, we further explore the implications of this\ngrowth on local labor markets, particularly focusing on the extent to which banking sector\nreforms shifted labor from agricultural to manufacturing sectors. On one hand, the growth\nof manufacturing firms, acting as a pull-side factor, creates new industrial job opportunities\nand elevates wages in the manufacturing sector. As a consequence, the reform might \u201ctrickle-\n28down\u201d to poor households and draw workers away from agriculture.35On the other hand,\nimproved access to finance could also stimulate agricultural investments, potentially increas-\ning the marginal productivity of agricultural labor.36Hence, the net effect on inter-sectoral\nlabor reallocation is ex-anteunclear.\nFurthermore, existing literature has highlighted substantial inter-sectoral labor mobility\ncosts in India, potentially confining labor to agriculture even in the face of low productiv-\nity.Munshi and Rosenzweig (2016) highlights that the wage gap between urban and rural\nareas in India is substantial, with urban wages being over 47% higher than rural wages\neven for unskilled workers. This wage gap remains constant over time and is significantly\nlarger than in other developing countries, such as China and Indonesia. Surprisingly, despite\nthe potential for higher wages in urban areas, rural workers in India do not capitalize on\nthese arbitrage opportunities, as evidenced by the country\u2019s low migration rate.37Several\nfactors may impede labor mobility and lead to the misallocation of labor in India, includ-\ning limited access to transportation infrastructure such as roads ( Asher and Novosad ,2020)\nand the informal insurance networks deeply rooted in the traditional caste system ( Munshi\nand Rosenzweig ,2016). Consequently, it remains an empirical question whether industrial\ngrowth can effectively release workers trapped in the agricultural sector, particularly those\nwith lower agricultural productivity.\nIn this section, we illustrate that bank expansion, by fueling industrial growth and creat-\ning more non-agricultural job opportunities in treated districts, can alleviate labor misallo-\ncation. Farmers in villages with lower agricultural suitability strongly respond to the reform\nand transition away from agriculture. To quantify this effect, we utilize the village-level\npopulation census data from 2001 and 2011,38matched with crop suitability data from the\n35In a similar vein, Barboni et al. (2021) investigates the effects of bank expansion also in the context of\nIndia, leveraging experimental evidence. Their study reveals that while bank expansion facilitated greater\naccess to loans for impoverished rural households, the recipients primarily used these loans for consumption\npurposes rather than for investment. Despite this consumption-focused utilization of loans, these households\nexperienced an increase in rural income. This outcome is potentially attributed to the \u201ctrickling-down\u201d\neffect: the heightened economic activity engendered by the expansion of banking services indirectly catalyzes\nan increase in local wages.\n36Agricultural investments and new technology can potentially lower the marginal productivity of labor,\nas exemplified by the case of Brazil\u2019s GE soybean seeds ( Bustos et al. ,2016). However, Madhok et al. (2022)\ndemonstrates that, in India, most agricultural investments serve to augment labor rather than replace it.\n37Drawing on detailed district-wise migration flow data from the 2001 population census, Kone et al.\n(2018) underscores that the 5-year inter-district migration rate in India is remarkably low, at a mere 2.8%.\nIn stark contrast, the 5-year inter-prefecture migration rate in China stands significantly higher at 10%. In\nlight of these facts, spatial sorting of workers according to skills a la Young(2014) is insu\ufb00icient to explain\nthe substantial rural-urban wage gap in India.\n38Villages in India are typically small, with approximately 500,000 in total, each averaging around 1,000\ninhabitants. Over 70% of all main workers are engaged in the agricultural sector.\n29FAO Global Agro-Ecological Zones (GAEZ)39as facilitated by Shrug ( Asher and Novosad ,\n2020). Villages are sorted into quartiles based on their crop suitability withina sub-district,\nwhere they likely encounter similar industrial labor demands.\nWe then evaluate the treatment effect of bank expansion on the number of farmers in each\nquartile separately. More specifically, we estimate the following empirical equation using the\nlocal linear RD approach with MSE-optimal bandwidth, following the methodology proposed\nbyCalonico et al. (2014).\nYids=\u03b21UnderBank ds+\u03b22Ratio ds+\u03b23UnderBank ds\u2217Ratio ds+Xids+\u03c3s+\u03b5ids\ns.t.\u2212h < Ratio id< h\nHere idenotes village, ddenotes district, and sdenotes state.

We control for\nthe ratio\u2019s components, village\u2019s land area, and population in 2001 in Xids, and state fixed\neffect in \u03c3s. We also control for the baseline measures (using the 2001 population census)\nof the respective variable of interest as recommended by Lee and Lemieux (2010).his the\nestimated MSE-optimal bandwidth. Standard errors are clustered at the district level.\nFigure7illustrates the treatment effect on the log number of farmers by cereal crop\nsuitability quartiles. The number of farmers decreases by roughly 40% in villages with the\nlowest crop suitability, as demonstrated on the left side of the plot. As we move to villages\nwith higher crop suitability, the treatment effect gradually diminishes in magnitude and\nbecomes statistically indistinguishable from zero. These findings align with the hypothesis\nthat bank expansion reduces labor misallocation by encouraging labor mobility away from\nthe agricultural sector in villages with lower agricultural productivity.\nThe calculation of crop suitability requires an assumption about input usage.40While the\nfarming system in India typically aligns more closely with the low-input case (represented by\nblue lines), our findings remain robust under the assumptions of high-input usage (indicated\n39The GAEZ crop suitability data has been extensively applied in the literature, as reviewed by Donaldson\nand Storeygard (2016), among others. GAEZ utilizes agronomic models to predict potential crop yields based\non location characteristics (including topography and soil type) under various levels of input usage.\n40Underthelow-input/traditionalmanagementscenario, farmingispredominantlysubsistence-based, with\npractices involving the use of traditional cultivars, labor-intensive techniques, minimal nutrient and pest con-\ntrol, and limited conservation measures. Conversely, the high-input/advanced management scenario assumes\nimproved high-yielding varieties, full mechanization with low labor intensity, and optimal applications of\nnutrients and chemical pest, disease, and weed control.\n30Figure 7: Treatment Effect of Bank Expansion on log(Farmer) by Crop Suitability\nby red lines). Here, as reported in Table B.6, we document the effects on the logarithm of the\nnumber of farmers, controlling for the village population in 2001. Table B.12confirms that\nour estimates are quantitatively similar when using the number of farmers as an alternative\noutcome variable. As a placebo test, we use data from the 2001 population census in Table\nB.9, revealing that the reform had no discernible effects on cultivators prior to the policy\nimplementation for any given quartile. This indicates that the effects we found in the post-\nreform period are not merely a result of pre-existing trends or other factors unrelated to the\nbank expansion.\nLabor demand or labor supply? The results presented in Figure 7lend support to our\nmain hypothesis that industrial growth creates more job opportunities in non-agricultural\nsectors and thus facilitates structural transformation. However, it is important to consider\nan alternative hypothesis that bank expansion may also increase industrial labor supply.\nAssuming non-homothetic preferences, such as a subsistence consumption requirement for\nagricultural goods, workers in places with lower agricultural productivity may self-select into\nagriculture because they are poorer ( Lagakos and Waugh ,2013). Bank expansion would\nhave a stronger impact in less productive places by relaxing this subsistence requirement and\nincreasing industrial labor supply.\nTo provide additional evidence supporting our hypothesis regarding the role of labor\ndemand, we examine the heterogeneous effects of the reform. If the labor demand hypothesis\nis valid, we would expect to see a stronger effect of the reform in villages that can better\n31(a) Rural Road\n (b) Distance to Population Center\nFigure 8: Heterogeneity in the Effect of Bank Expansion\nleverage the industrial expansion. These could include villages near urban centers ( Madhok\net al.,2022), where there is higher demand for labor due to industrial growth. Additionally,\nvillagesconnectedbyroadsmayalsoexperienceastrongerimpact, asimprovedinfrastructure\nfacilitates the movement of goods and labor between rural and urban areas ( Asher and\nNovosad,2020).\nOn the other hand, if the labor supply channel is the main driver of the results, we would\nanticipate a more pronounced response to the reform in more isolated and remote villages.\nIn these areas, the subsistence requirement may have a greater impact on labor allocation\ndecisions, and the relaxation of this requirement through bank expansion could result in a\ngreater shift in labor from agriculture to non-agricultural sectors.\nFigure8presents the impact of bank expansion on employment in villages with and\nwithout road connections (left panel), as well as those situated close to or far from population\ncenters with populations exceeding 10,000 (right panel). It becomes evident that villages\nconnected by roads and those closer to population centers exhibit a stronger response to\nthe bank expansion reform. In these locales, we observe a more pronounced decrease in the\nnumber of cultivators and agricultural laborers, coupled with an increase in \u2018other workers\u2019\n(including workers in both manufacturing and service sectors). These patterns suggest that\nsubsistence requirements and the labor supply channel alone are insu\ufb00icient to explain the\nstructural transformation documented in our results.\nThe regression results are reported in Table B.7andB.8. Table B.13and Table B.14\nconfirm that our estimates are similar using levels instead of logs as outcome variables.\nUsing data from the 2001 population census as a placebo test, Table B.10and Table B.11\nshow that the estimates tend to be much smaller and less statistically significant before the\npolicy implementation, thus further support our identification strategy.\n32Intriguingly, we also note a decline in \u2018other workers\u2019 and a non-significant increase in\nagricultural laborers in villages without road connections or those situated further from pop-\nulation centers. This pattern suggests a spatial reallocation of agricultural activities to places\nwith lesser access to industrial job opportunities, echoing the results reported in Madhok et\nal.(2022). This reallocation could be driven by two channels. First, bank expansion could\ndirectly impact agricultural investments and activities, and this effect may be more evident\nin remote and isolated areas. Second, there could be a general equilibrium effect of bank\nexpansion. If farmers in neighboring villages transition to non-agricultural sectors, local\nfood prices could increase, rendering farming more profitable. We plan to assess the relative\nstrength of these two channels in our quantitative exercise.\n6 Concluding Remarks\nIn conclusion, this paper provides a comprehensive analysis of the impacts of bank expansion\non industrial growth and labor allocation based on a nationwide policy experiment in India.\nOur findings reveal that the expansion of banks in under-banked districts alleviated firms\u2019\nborrowing constraints, stimulating their growth in sales revenue, employment, and capital\naccumulation. However, contrary to initial expectations, the expansion did not translate\ninto increased firm dynamics or higher entry rates. Moreover, we find that this policy had\nminimal effects on product innovation and total factor productivity. This policy primarily\nbenefited incumbent firms and left potential entrants largely unaffected, hinting at limited\ndynamic gains from bank expansion.\nOn the labor front, we find that bank expansion created more high-paying jobs and led\nto a significant labor reallocation towards the manufacturing sector, particularly in regions\nwith lower agricultural productivity. This labor movement underscores the role of manu-\nfacturing development as a significant \u201clabor pull\u201d factor, shaping the process of structural\ntransformation.\nMoving forward, we plan to delve deeper into these findings by constructing a spatial\ngeneral equilibrium model. This model will help us interpret our empirical results and quan-\ntify the aggregate effects of bank expansion. With this model, we intend to examine the\nconsequences of the reform on aggregate economic growth, resource allocation, and labor\nmobility. We also aim to calibrate this model with the micro-estimates derived from our\ncurrent analysis. Additionally, we aim to explore various policy counterfactuals, such as the\npotential e\ufb00iciency gains from relaxing migration constraints compared to merely increasing\nthe bank presence in underdeveloped regions.\n33References\nAllcott, Hunt, Allan Collard-W exler, and Stephen D O\u2019Connell , \u201cHow do electricity\nshortages affect industry?
