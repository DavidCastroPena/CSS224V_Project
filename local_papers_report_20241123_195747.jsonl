Thus, by proposing to open more branches\nin areas that the RBI has designated as \u201cunder-banked,\u201d banks can increase their chances\nof obtaining licenses for their preferred locations. This policy thus effectively \u201cbundled\u201d the\nentry into under-banked districts with those into more profitable districts.6 7\n5In India, the banking sector does not permit free entry of banks or bank branches. Banks are required\nto apply for and acquire licenses from the RBI prior to opening any new branch. Additionally, banks must\nalso request approval to close or relocate branches in most markets.\n6To make their license-issuance decisions, the RBI also evaluates banks based on other factors, such as\nthe bank\u2019s provision of \u201cno-frills\u201d accounts, adherence to priority sector lending obligations, and complaint\nresolution record. However, these requirements are applied at the bank level, not the individual branch level.\nFor more details on the reform, refer to the 2005 issue of the RBI\u2019s Master Circular on Branch Authorization .\n7Banks in India are not allowed to relocate their branches if they leave a market \u201cunbanked\u201d", "Similarity Score": 0.7709067463874817}

But whether or not a\ngovernment bank branch opens in these a priori treated cities after the policy is adopted (i.e.,\nwhether the assigned unit takes the treatment) is potentially endogenous to their economic\noutcomes.21\n20. This is because the exogeneity of the assignment does not bear on the exogeneity of the receipt of\ntreatment if the receipt of treatment is different from the assignment to treatment (e.g., Athey and Imbens,\n2017).\n21. To be able to use a staggered treatment, there would have to exist an official staggered assignment rule\nbut none of the official program documentation we examined suggests this was the case.

However, it\nis important to emphasize that our setting is conceptually different. By construction, public\nbanks are present in all control cities prior to the reform.

Bank branch\nproximity mitigates the transaction costs of mobilizing savings from many agents, which\ncan increase the capital available to entrepreneurs. Branch proximity also lowers the cost to\nbanks of screening and monitoring entrepreneurs, and of providing access to liquidity services.\nHowever, setting up bank branches is not only costly but also risky, as demand for deposits\nand loans can only be observed after the creation of the branch, which can lead to an under-\nprovision of financial services.\nFor this reason, policymakers across the world have sought to promote financial inclu-\nsion by implementing large-scale reforms to expand the physical networks of bank branches.1\nThe popularity of these financial inclusion policies raises multiple questions: do they suc-\nceed in promoting financial and economic development and, if so, how? And what are the\ndistributional consequences of such policies?\nIn this paper, we trace out the dynamic effects on both economic development and wage\ninequality of a government program that improved access to mainstream financial services.\nWe use the introduction of the \u201cBanks for All\u201d program ( \u201cBanco para Todos\u201d ) by the Brazil-\nian federal government in 2004, which explicitly targeted underbanked cities by introducing\nbranches of government-owned banks", "Similarity Score": 0.7381232976913452}

Thissituationstarklycontrastswith\ndeveloped economies like the United States, where a mere 4.5% of households are \u201cunbanked\u201d\n(FDIC,2021). This deprivation from finance could impede economic development by curbing\naggregate investment and employment and distorting capital allocation among firms and\npotential entrepreneurs ( Hsieh and Klenow ,2009;Buera et al. ,2011;Bazzi et al. ,2021;\nFonseca and Matray ,2022).\nMany developing countries have implemented place-based policies to stimulate bank ex-\npansion in lagging regions, believing that these policies have the potential to ignite economic\ngrowth and alleviate poverty through better access to financial services. Previous literature,\nutilizing both Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs) and natural experiments, tends to high-\nlight substantial benefits to industrial growth and household well-being in areas that have\nseen an influx of banking services ( Burgess and Pande ,2005;Bruhn and Love ,2014;Young,\n2017;Cramer,2021;Fonseca and Matray ,2022;Barboni et al. ,2021)", "Similarity Score": 0.729595959186554}

This shift not only enhanced women's familiarity and comfort with mobile money but\nalso empowered them by providing a private and secure platform to manage their funds, thereby enabling greater financial\ncontrol and decision-making within their households [23],\u00a0. The promotion of savings among vulnerable women in Kenya through\nmobile banking increased individual financial security but led to a reduction in informal sharing of financial burden arrangements\nwithin communities, potentially leaving vulnerable populations more exposed to shocks. While savings initiatives can positively\nimpact welfare, policymakers should carefully consider their interaction with existing informal systems to ensure comprehensive\nrisk management strategies for women in low- and middle-income countries [20]. Policymakers must prioritize promoting digital\nfinancial services for women's empowerment, while ensuring interventions address barriers and unintended consequences to\nfoster comprehensive financial inclusion strategies.Mobile instant credit can improve resilience, subjective well-being, and investments in education of consumers.\nHowever, it is important to acknowledge the potential risks to borrowers.

Consistent with the idea that\neconomic development is a \u201ctide that lifts all boats,\u201d we find that all workers benefit from\nthe reform. However, workers in the first quartile of the distribution (the purple line) gain\nfar less than workers in the last quartile (the red line), and wage gains increase monotonically\nwith the initial position in the wage distribution.\nTable 6 reports estimates of equation (1). The point estimates tend to underestimate the\neffect of the reform on inequality since, as Figure 8bshows, inequality rises steadily over time,\nwhile these regression results show the average over the whole post-reform period. The Gini\nincreases on average by 1.2 points (column 1), which is driven by larger wages gains at the\ntop of the income distribution.

The networked  nature of mobile  \nmoney  in the context  of remittances  gets women  included,  unlike formal \ufb01nancial  services  that are not networked.  As \nKusimba  et al. (2017) illustrates  for western  Kenya, women,  especially  mothers,  are central  to the social networks  around  \nmobile  money.  \nOver time, these social networks\u2014and  the cultural  links that run through  them\u2014may  shift, and, when they do, digital \n\ufb01nancial  technology  may open different  obligations  and possibilities  for both men and women.

Studies consistently find that the\nintegration of mobile money accounts with traditional banking systems increased savings deposits in addition to\nproviding a variety of other benefits [1],\u00a0[9],\u00a0[24],\u00a0[33]. In Malawi, urban microentrepreneurs were more likely to increase both\nthe quantity and value of mobile money deposits (ranging from 55 to 80 percent and 67 to 83 percent, respectively) when they\nreceived access to mobile money provider saving accounts, support in opening accounts, training on basic transactions, and a\nwaiver on withdrawal fees. It is worth noting, in this context, that access to mobile money influenced a shift in labor allocation\ntoward farming away from their main business, potentially suggesting that farm labor has higher expected financial gains, while\nbusiness earnings are used for meeting more immediate daily financial needs. However, the delay in payoff and risk had induced\npeople to instead work in their main microenterprise [1],\u00a0. In other economies like Mozambique, providing access to mobile\nsavings accounts and enhancing financial management skills has proven beneficial for female-led microenterprises", "Similarity Score": 0.6934870481491089}

Remittances increased sharing of financial burdens and resilience, all while households shifted from subsistence\nagriculture to more productive occupations by 4.4 percentage points, highlighting the potential for mobile money to drive\n\u00a0significant economic shifts [8]. This makes the investment in the rollout of mobile money a promising policy option for\npolicymakers seeking to foster poverty reduction, resilience against shocks, and financial inclusion in underserved regions.\nHowever, local constraints may limit the impacts of mobile money. In Afghanistan, violence and conflict deterred individuals from\nusing mobile money as a means of financial inclusion, emphasizing the need to address security issues to unlock the potential of\nsuch services [11],\u00a0. Similarly, in remote areas of northern Uganda, the rollout of mobile money agents did not lead to the\nexpected increase in usage, likely due to low baseline rates of mobile phone ownership, mobile money transactions, and\nremittance receipts. However, there is evidence it did reduce transportation costs by 76 percent for those receiving remittances\nand enhance food security [36]", "Similarity Score": 0.6895736455917358}

Since skilled workers require higher wages and are arguably more expensive to recruit\nand train, financial frictions disproportionately constrain the demand for skilled labor and,\nwhen lessened by the reform, lead to an increase in the demand for skilled labor relative to\nunskilled labor.\nAlternatively, if capital and skilled labor are relative complements, looser financial con-\nstraints can increase capital investment and, consequently, increase the marginal productivity\nof skilled workers relative to unskilled workers, also leading to an increase in the relative\ndemand for skilled workers (Fonseca and Doornik, 2021). A testable implication of either ver-\nsion of the skilled labor demand hypothesis is that, as the relative demand for skilled workers\n35rises, both the relative price and the relative quantity of skilled workers should rise, leading\nto an increase in the skill premium andin the share of skilled workers in treated cities.\nThird, labor demand might go up uniformly across the skill distribution, but the supply\nof unskilled workers could be more elastic than the supply of skilled workers", "Similarity Score": 0.689251184463501}

One is that they create \na socially-bound commitment to save. However, \nsavings groups tend to be less liquid and flexible \nthan other savings tools, potentially making them \nless well-suited to small, but common shocks. \nWhile we know savings groups can help people \nsave, evidence on the impact of savings groups on \nresilience and consumption smoothing is mixed", "Similarity Score": 0.6891152858734131}

The results presented in Figure 6lend support to our\nmain hypothesis that industrial growth creates more job opportunities in non-agricultural\nsectors and thus facilitates structural transformation. However, it is important to consider\nan alternative hypothesis that bank expansion may also increase industrial labor supply.\nAssuming non-homothetic preferences, such as a subsistence consumption requirement for\nagricultural goods, workers in places with lower agricultural productivity may self-select into\nagriculture because they are poorer ( Lagakos and Waugh ,2013). Bank expansion would\nhave a stronger impact in less productive places by relaxing this subsistence requirement and\nincreasing industrial labor supply.\nTo provide additional evidence supporting our hypothesis regarding the role of labor\ndemand, we examine the heterogeneous effects of the reform.

To proxy for the potential supply of skilled\nlabor, we use the share of the local population with 11 years or more of education from the\n2000 Demographic Census. The intuition behind this measure is that if a treated city faces\na shortage of skilled workers, we should observe an abnormally large skill premium. In order\nto determine what is abnormally large, we compare the skill premium in treated cities with\nthe skill premium in the same industry-by-firm-size category in control cities.\nOur measure of the relative supply of skilled labor is based on the population census,\nwhich has the advantage of neither being affected by the fraction of workers in the informal\nsector, nor reflecting the equilibrium outcomes in the formal labor market. As a robustness\ncheck, we supplement this measure by computing a measure of the \u201cskill gap\u201d at the city\nlevel to construct that measure. We split firms into employment size quartiles according to\nthe city-year distribution and, for each year in the pre-reform period, we compute the skill\npremium in each city-industry-firm-size cell for both treated and control cities. We then take\nthe ratio of treated to control skill premium at the industry-firm-size level and define the skill\ngap as the city-level mean of all industry-firm-size ratios in a given city", "Similarity Score": 0.6718246936798096}

These models generally conclude that capital income pushes inequality upward, as it\nmostly benefits the wealthy and entrepreneurs, while rising wages push inequality downward\n(e.g., Buera, Kaboski, and Shin, 2021; Ji, Teng, and Townsend, 2023). These theoretical and\nquantitative results that wage inequality should go down as financial development increases\nrely on the assumption that labor is a homogeneous input to production. Therefore, higher\nlabor demand in more-productive sectors will benefit more lower-paid workers who reallocate\naway from less-productive sectors.\nOur contribution to this literature is twofold. First, we provide rare empirical evidence on\nthe effect of financial inclusion on wage inequality, as empirical evidence focuses on developed\ncountries and studies credit rather than financial inclusion.9Second, we show that financial\ninclusion leads to higher wage inequality in our setting due to skill differentials.

However, when looking at the effect\nof the policy on the average skill composition of firms, we find that the share of skilled workers\ndoes not increase in treated cities.\nInstead, we find support for another explanation: skills are scarce, especially in developing\ncountries, which means that the supply of skilled workers is more inelastic than that of\nunskilled workers in the short run. We show that cities in our setting are characterized by\nhigh internal migration costs and that the reform does not induce worker migration to treated\ncities. This lack of inter-city mobility implies that an increase in labor demand can only be\nserved by the supply of local workers. Consistent with skilled workers being in short supply,\nwe find that all the increase in inequality is concentrated in cities where a lower fraction of\nthe population is educated prior to the reform.\nWe consider a wide range of robustness checks.

In turn the firm\u2019s\nloan size depends on \u03c3i, the offered interest rate, and the prevailing wage and rental rate of\ncapital.\nEquation 7shows that bank profits depend on market size, \u2126t, and the distribution of\n\u03c3,F\u03c3,t. For entrants, profits also depend on the entry cost, \u03b4. From Equations 5and6,\nprofits also depend on the number of other banks in the market. Since banks are symmetric,\nthe number of banks determines the degree of competition in the banking sector. When the\nnumber of banks is small, banks\u2019 pricing decisions have equilibrium effects on total market\nsize, resulting in higher interest rates. As the number of banks increases interest rates fall.\nIn turn firms that face lower interest rates take out bigger loans, which increases their labor\ninputs, capital inputs, output, and revenue.\n306", "Similarity Score": 0.6279142498970032}

This suggests that our observed firm expansion results are\nprimarily driven by the growth of incumbent firms, rather than changes in the composition\nof firms.\nHowever, a closer examination reveals substantial variation across firm sizes. Column 2\npresents the heterogeneous treatment effects, in which our \u201cTreated*Post\u201d term is interacted\nwith a \u201cBig\u201d dummy variable, assigned as 1 if a firm\u2019s average employment surpasses the\nnational average.27The main \u201cTreated*Post\u201d term suggests an increase in the exit rate of\nsmaller firms by 4.7 percentage points (approximately 70% of the sample mean). This aligns\nwith our theoretical framework, as the reform raises the exit rate among smaller firms due\nto the elevation of the unconstrained productivity threshold. Interestingly, this main effect\nis almost entirely offset by the interaction term, indicating that larger firms\u2019 exit rates are\nunaffected by the reform. Regarding firm entry, the reform also exerts a slightly larger,\nalbeit still insignificant, effect on the entry of larger firms, consistent with our model. To\nfurther validate our findings, we present additional results in columns 3-5 using the baseline\nDifference-in-Discontinuity specification, disaggregated by firm sizes.

To test whether a change in the relative demand\nfor skilled workers can explain the rise in wage inequality, we need an ex-ante, time-invariant\ndefinition of skill. We leverage the fact that the Brazilian matched employer-employee data\nallow us to observe education and classify workers as skilled if they have at least some college\neducation and unskilled otherwise.34\nIn Table 8, we start by showing that this measure tracks the evolution of inequality well.\nIn column 1, we show that the skill premium increases by 8.3% (column 1) and that this\nincrease is driven by a much faster increase in the wage of skilled workers (+11.8%, column\n2) than unskilled workers (+2.8%, column 3). These magnitudes are actually bigger than the\n32. Another potential way of testing for sorting would be to study the correlation between firm and worker\nfixed effects, but, as Eeckhout and Kircher (2011) and Lopes de Melo (2018) show, this correlation does not\nmeasure the strength of sorting in a general setting.\n33. See Bombardini, Orefice, and Tito (2019) for an application of this method in a trade context.\n34. This is a less stringent definition than studies looking at developed countries who use college education\nas a proxy, since we include college dropouts in our definition of skilled.\n36Table 7: Dispersion in Worker Type\nDep\nendent variable: Std.
