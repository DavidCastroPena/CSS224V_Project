For all \ncounties in the U.S. from 1973-83 the mean and median mortality rate for children 5-9 from \nHead Start susceptible causes equaled around 2.0 and 1.8 per 100,000, respectively.

In\n1915, the South initially had a mortality advantage over the North for black infants, as shown in\nFigure 8.19Much of the gap is explained by the existence of a black urban-rural penalty combined\nwith the fact that Northern blacks lived in cities, but were primarily rural in the South.20Northern\ninfant mortality rates converged with the South as the urban penalty gradually declined over the\ncourse of the early 20th century. In the published data, the North overtook the South by the\nearly 1930s in terms of black infant health. Three main implications emerge from using the revised\nestimates. First, the southern mortality advantage widens as the adjustment method primarily\nlowers black IMR in the South. Second, starting from a lower initial IMR in the South implies\na faster convergence rate between the regions.

There are no significant discontinuities in either other causes of death or \nage groups that should not be affected by Head Start. \n Our evidence for positive Head Start impacts on educational attainment is suggestive, \nalthough neither of the data sources available to us is quite ideal.  We show that there are \nstatistically significant positive discontinuities in high school completion and college attendance \nin the 1990 Census, concentrated among cohorts exposed to Head Start", "Similarity Score": 0.7571349143981934}

The test suggested\nthat underregistration in some states was quite severe in total, and particularly poor for blacks.\nFor example, only 77.6 percent of births were registered in South Carolina versus 99.4 percent in\nConnecticut. In general, the South had the highest level of underregistration.4\nWe produce annual, 2-year, and 5-year adjusted estimates of births, infant mortality rates, and\nmaternal mortality rates by state and race, as well as at the national level, to account for the\nwell-documented severe underregistration of births.5The adjustment procedure estimates births\nby adding together the enumeration of live children in the census, the number of infant deaths,\nand the number of non-infant deaths", "Similarity Score": 0.7567191123962402}

A timing mismatch\nbetween the measurement of the mechanisms (sometimes only collected in later KLPS survey\nrounds) and intergenerational child mortality, for instance, make it difficult to establish tight\ncausal claims. Furthermore, given that the hypothesized mechanisms were not themselves\nrandomized in the original study design, mediation analysis may lead to biased inference\nalong the lines of the problem of \u201cbad control\u201d (Angrist and Pischke, 2009).\nThe point estimate on intergenerational infant (under-1) mortality is negative, and the\nproportional reduction in infant mortality is broadly in line with the reduction in under-\n5 mortality, but the infant mortality effect is not statistically significant. Several factors\nmay explain differences between the IMR and U5MR results. Previous studies suggest\n12that different pathways are more important in explaining intergenerational infant versus\nunder-5 mortality. Importantly, deworming led to improvements in adult socioeconomic\nand education outcomes, which are more commonly associated with U5MR (Omariba et\nal., 2007). We also find that deworming reduces the likelihood of miscarriage. Somewhat\nspeculatively, this would suggests that some additional children who may be less healthy are\nbeing born in the treated group; if these children are more susceptible to neonatal infections,\nthe leading cause of infant mortality globally (Liu et al., 2016), this would dampen the\ntreatment effect on infant mortality", "Similarity Score": 0.7523977160453796}

In 1965 the Office of Economic Opportunity (OEO) provided technical\nassistance to the 300 poorest counties in the U.S. to develop Head Start funding proposals. The result\nwas a large and lasting discontinuity in Head Start funding rates at the OEO cutoff for grant-writing\nassistance, but no discontinuity in other forms of federal social spending. We find evidence of a large\nnegative discontinuity at the OEO cutoff in mortality rates for children ages 5-9 from causes that\ncould be affected by Head Start, but not for other mortality causes or birth cohorts that should not\nbe affected by the program. We also find suggestive evidence for a positive effect of Head Start on\neducational attainment in both the 1990 Census, concentrated among those cohorts born late enough\nto have been exposed to the program, and among respondents in the National Education Longitudinal\nStudy of 1988.\nJens Ludwig\nGeorgetown University\nPublic Policy Institute\n3520 Prospect Street, NW\nWashington, DC 20007\nand NBER\nludwigj@georgetown.edu\nDouglas L.

In the absence of a complete death\nindex for the entire country, we do not have complete information on children that died outside\nof their state of birth. Bias enters in the case where states experience di\u000berential net migration\n10rates, or di\u000berential mortality rates. We split the discussion of bias from migrant deaths into two\nparts: infant deaths and non-infant deaths. Infant deaths are allocated to the state of occurrence\nregardless of the child's birth state as we have no information on state of birth for deaths in this\nage group. As the out-of-state migration rate for infants is small (less than 1 percent in 1940), and\nmost infant deaths occur in the \frst 30 days of life, and the likelihood of migration with a sick\ninfant is relatively small, we believe the potential bias from this source is limited.\nBoth the cumulative likelihood of migration and the hazard rate increase with age, implying an\nincreased potential for non-infant children to die outside of their state of birth. Thus, deaths of\nchildren aged 1 and above outside of their state of birth present a larger pathway for bias to enter\nthe estimates. Working in the opposite direction, however, is the fact that mortality rates decrease\nrapidly after the \frst year of life, as do cross-state di\u000berentials in age-speci\fc mortality.

In practice the \nPSID, which like the NELS is intended to be representative at the national but not the state \n(much less county) level, appears to provide an unrepresentative draw of people in the treatment \ncounties just above the OEO cutoff.  The result is that among PSID sample members who \nanswered the 1995 Head Start question, we do not see the discontinuity in Head Start \nparticipation that we observe in the NELS and the county-level federal spending data.  For this \nreason we do not use the PSID to directly estimate the effects of Head Start on outcomes using \nthe OEO discontinuity.  However we do exploit the availability of geo-coded data for the larger \nPSID sample in all poor counties to explore the problem of selective across-county migration \nwith our NELS and county-level data.45 \n                                                 \n45 An alternative explanation for the difference between the PSID and NELS in documenting a Head Start \ndiscontinuity at the OEO cutoff is that the Head Start variable with the former may suffer from relatively greater \nmeasurement error.  The reason is that while the NELS asks parents of potential Head Start participants to report on \nprogram involvement 10 years after their children would have been age-eligible to participate, the PSID asks people \nto self-report on whether they were in Head Start from 15 to 25 years after they would have been of Head Start age", "Similarity Score": 0.7461814284324646}

Furthermore, the limited sample size allowed for the gathering of\nmultiple rounds of rich survey data with low rates of sample attrition, which enables us to\nanalyze how adult life changes translate into child survival outcomes, including via multiple\nhypothesized mechanisms. Despite not being nationally-representative, the KLPS sample\nappears to be fairly typical of other SSA settings (see Appendix B). Furthermore, given the\nhigh prevalence of intestinal helminth infections in SSA and globally, the findings on the\ncausal intergenerational impacts of deworming are relevant in many other settings.\nThese findings suggest that deworming treatment has implications not only for reducing\n13infection rates and improving living standards among the current generation, but also po-\ntentially far-reaching implications on improving child survival (and possibly other outcomes)\nof the subsequent generation, along the lines of the \u201ctriple dividend\u201d proposed by Patton\net al.

Possible outcome areas include parents\u2019 mental health and wellbeing, livelihoods or income, education, health, and relationships.

Figure 1: A Dual Generation Approach to Parenting Programs in International Contexts  One key challenge for designing interventions with a dual generation framework is that they can span multiple sectors and thus might be difficult to implement. This is especially true in humanitarian settings, where sectors are known to be strictly siloed.38 Integrating a nutrition intervention into a parenting program might be prevented by restrictions around which actors can distribute food and certain resources in refugee camps. This is a broader challenge for the field of early childhood development, though, and is not unique to a two-generation approach.  Still, there are many possibilities for expanding the scope of parenting interventions while operating within the delivery structure and format of existing programs and without having to confront more of the entrenched dynamics of systems and sectors", "Similarity Score": 0.7416670322418213}

Results for Head Start Funding and Participation \n What effect did OEO\u2019s Head Start grant-writing assistance to the 300 poorest counties \nhave on Head Start funding?   Historical documents note that 240 (80%) of these 300 counties \nreceived Head Start funding (GAO, 1981), compared to 43% of all counties nationwide \n(estimated from our 1968 federal expenditure data).  Data from the NELS and for county-level \nfederal expenditures are consistent with these historical accounts. \n Table 1 shows that for the 349 \u201ccontrol\u201d counties with 1960 poverty rates that are within \n10 percentage points of the OEO cutoff from below (49.198 to 59.198), average Head Start \nspending per 4 year old in 1968 was equal to $134 (in 1968 dollars).  For the 228 \u201ctreatment\u201d \ncounties with 1960 poverty rates 10 percentage points above the OEO cutoff this figure is $288 \nper 4 year old, more than twice as much.  In 1972 Head Start spending per 4 year-old is still \nnearly 60% higher in the treatment than control counties. \n In Figure 1 we show that the difference shown in Table 1 in Head Start funding around \nthe OEO cutoff is driven in large part by a sharp drop-off in spending at the cutoff itself", "Similarity Score": 0.741375207901001}
{"Source": "papers/DoesHeadStartImproveChildrenLifeChances.pdf", "Content": ".  For 1968 and 1972 head start funding, there are also other minima in the range of \n34 percent poor.  However we are not concerned that these represent a discontinuity related to the \nHead Start program, as this roughly corresponds to the 56th percentile of county poverty rates.  In \naddition, these minima are located in a region with much greater density of data, where the \ndegrees-of-freedom differences (due to greater density) can confound the goodness of fit \nmeasure.  Finally, we note the only region that experiences an improved goodness of fit across all \nthree first stage measures is the region around the 300th poorest county.  On the whole, then, we \ntake this evidence as confirmatory that there is a discontinuity happening at our threshold. \nD. Discontinuities in Other Spending \n A final potential challenge to our identification of Head Start impacts with our research \ndesign comes from the possibility of discontinuities in other forms of social spending at the OEO \ncutoff.  This seems unlikely since the decision to focus Head Start grant-writing assistance in the \n300 poorest counties seems to have been made arbitrarily within the Head Start office rather than \nas some part of larger OEO-wide policy", "Similarity Score": 0.7410355806350708}

Figure 2 plots adjusted infant mortality when allocating non-\ninfant deaths to state of birth versus adjusted infant mortality when allocating non-infant deaths\nto state of occurrence.12The methods have a tight almost, one-for-one, relationship. Di\u000berences\ndo arise, however, from the high amounts of out-migration from southern states with large black\npopulations during the \\Great Migration\". Nevertheless, these di\u000berences are small. As such, we\nchoose to allocate non-infant deaths to states of birth in the revised estimates, but emphasize the\nlimited importance of migration in this context.\nTwo potential biases remain as concerns: additional underenumeration in the census that using\nlater censuses does not account for, and the underregistration of deaths. It is well known that\nthe decennial censuses of the early 20th century under counted young children (Greville, 1947;\nBrunsman, 1953). Our estimates of the number of births are biased downward to the extent\nunderenumeration occurred.

{"Source": "papers/ReversingInfantMortality.pdf", "Content": ". The likely explanation for this rapid improvement\nis that registration completeness is highly correlated with the percent of births delivered in a hospital. Completeness eventually\nreached close to 100 percent by the mid to late 1960s as hospital deliveries approached 100 percent of all births after the\nintegration of hospitals in the South (U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1973)\n5City-level infant mortality estimates are also biased from birth underregistration. However, we are loathe to use our\nprocedure to adjust rates at the city-level. The census records only state of birth, not city. Any allocation of census enumerations\nback to a city of birth would be plagued by bias from cross-city migration. Because state of birth is known, this migration bias\ndoes not a\u000bect our state based revised rates.\n3subsequently die and underenumeration of children in the decennial census. Bias from migration\nstems from children dying outside their state of birth; however, we show that a rough allocation\nof these non-infant deaths back to their state of birth does not meaningfully alter the estimates.\nUnderenumeration, when the census undercounts the number of children alive at the census date,\nposes a more challenging problem. To partially resolve this issue, we use the number of children\ncounted in a later census rather than the \frst census in which a child should be enumerated (e.g. 11\nyear olds in the 1940 census rather than 1 year olds in the 1930 census for the 1929 birth year)", "Similarity Score": 0.7360055446624756}

Much of the regional di\u000berence was\nsuspected to arise from regional di\u000berences in urbanization and rates of hospital births (Moriyama,\n1946). The racial disparity can also be explained by a largely rural black population in South\nwith very low rates of hospital delivery. Although diminished, the racial di\u000berence remains when\ncomparing within cities and within category of place of delivery.\nThe test suggests that births - especially black births - were systematically under-registered at\nhigher rates in southern states relative to northern states, inducing an upward bias in reported\ninfant mortality for the South.

We take this as our\nprime motivation for revising mortality estimates from 1910-1940.\nB.

Introduction \n \nThis paper provides new evidence on the effects of the Head Start program on schooling \nand health by drawing on a new source of variation in program funding.  We exploit a \ndiscontinuity in program funding across counties that resulted from how the Office of Economic \nOpportunity (OEO) launched the program during the spring of 1965 as part of the War on \nPoverty.  Head Start was established to provide preschool, health and other social services to \npoor children ages 3 or 4.  It represents one of the federal government\u2019s primary means for \naddressing the large disparities in cognitive and non-cognitive skills observed along race and \nclass lines well before children start school.1  Head Start currently serves over 800,000 children \neach year at a cost of around $7 billion (Haskins, 2004). \nEarly childhood may represent a particularly promising target for human capital \ninterventions given evidence that neurodevelopmental plasticity may decline with age, together \nwith the possibility of dynamic complementarities in learning (Duncan et al., 1998, Shonkoff and \nPhillips, 2000, Carniero and Heckman, 2003).  \u201cTwo generation\u201d programs like Head Start, \nwhich target parents as well as children, could also change the stream of human capital \ninvestments that parents make in their children over the life course", "Similarity Score": 0.733420193195343}

Supporting caregivers and their relationships with children can be an important strategy for improving early childhood development in contexts of forced displacement.  Parenting programs \u2013 interventions that aim to improve early childhood development outcomes through building parenting skills and knowledge and improving parent-child interactions \u2013 are one of the few interventions to consider both children and caregivers together.2 Across different low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), various parenting programs have been found to positively affect young children\u2019s development, as well as parenting practices and knowledge.3 However, parenting programs rarely focus on independent, non-parental outcomes for caregivers.  These interventions thus present a unique opportunity to apply a dual generation approach, where programs can be adapted to address their overall skills, knowledge, needs, and wellbeing, in addition to their parenting skills and knowledge. In this evidence synthesis, we aim to generate actionable insight for policy and practice in improving outcomes for forcibly displaced children aged 0-3 and their caregivers. We review relevant literature, theory, and implementation materials across multiple fields of research and intervention. In particular, we explore how dual-generation theory can be applied to early childhood development in contexts of forced displacement. We focus the core of this synthesis on a review of parenting programs for children ages 0-3", "Similarity Score": 0.7302647233009338}

{"Source": "papers/ImprovingOutcomesforYoungChildren.pdf", "Content": ". While a dual generation approach could be relevant for any family, the theory was designed for contexts of adversity, as these contexts are least served by traditional intervention. Vulnerable children might not benefit from direct intervention as much or at all if their broader context is not addressed, and the limited effects of existing interventions were partly what inspired dual generation approaches. As articulated by Shonkoff, \u201cachieving breakthrough outcomes for young children facing adversity requires supporting the adults who care for them to transform their own lives.\u201d37  Dual generation theory originated in the United States and certain details of its conceptualization might not transfer to other settings. For example, an emphasis on postsecondary educational opportunities or employment or livelihoods programs for parents, might not transfer to all contexts of forced displacement, but applying the core tenet of dual generation theory to such contexts holds great promise. Given the challenges facing children in contexts of forced displacement, and particularly the challenges facing children of adolescents, the applications of dual generation theory for child development may be one of the most potentially powerful.  Of existing humanitarian interventions, parenting programs are one of the most appropriate targets for a dual generation lens: they are already focused on early childhood development outcomes and include both the parent and the child", "Similarity Score": 0.729581892490387}

Recent systematic reviews have highlighted effects on sexual and reproductive health,54 health and life skills,55 and violence against girls.56 Key findings from these reviews suggest possible opportunities for intervention with adolescent parents in humanitarian settings, as well as potential challenges.

Promising research from contexts of forced displacement and post-conflict LMICs suggests that parenting programs can directly target the well-being of caregivers and lead to improved outcomes for both caregivers and their children. Programs that target adolescent parents and their children could improve life outcomes across two generations.

Applying a \"dual generation\" approach to early childhood practice and research could inspire the innovation needed to achieve breakthrough outcomes for both children and their caregivers. \nPicture Credit: \u00a9 Carsten ten Brink  3 Innovations for Poverty Action | poverty-action.org Introduction Worldwide, 43 percent of children under the age of 5 are at risk for not reaching their developmental potential, and yet access to high quality early childhood programming is inadequate and inequitable, particularly for children under the age of 3.1 Contexts of forced displacement represent an especially challenging setting for young children, as the issues that cause displacement and define refugee settings often contain acute threats to child development.  One of the most important protective factors for young children in mitigating the effects of severe adversity is a positive, responsive relationship with a caregiver", "Similarity Score": 0.7253251075744629}

One promising direction for future work builds off of a nascent trend in parenting programs in LMICs that is to consider the mental health of caregivers. An emerging evidence base focuses on maternal mental health in particular, given its prevalence and critical importance to young children\u2019s development.

Unfortunately, many of the factors which have been found to promote positive outcomes for adolescent parents and their children are exactly the factors most threatened by experiences of displacement: access to stable housing and income generating opportunities,19 as well as support from grandparents.20 Other factors, though, might be possible to encourage even in humanitarian settings, such as promoting natural mentors, educational aspirations, and ambitions.21 Interestingly, these factors seem to address parents\u2019 internal concerns, rather than their setting, suggesting that there might be ways to support adolescent caregivers beyond addressing the external context of poverty.  In targeting outcomes and designing programs for adolescent parents, it is also important to consider the legal context for young mothers.

The\nschools were first stratified by administrative subunit (zone), zones were listed alphabetically\nwithin each geographic division, and schools were ordered by pupil enrollment within each\nzone, with every third school then assigned to a given program group. Previous studies\nconfirm the validity of the research design and document that the groups were well-balanced\nalong a wide range of baseline characteristics (Miguel and Kremer, 2004; Baird et al., 2016).\nThe program was phased in across groups: Group 1 schools began treatment in 1998,\nGroup 2 schools in 1999, and Group 3 schools in 2001 (Figure A.1; see also Appendix\nB).

In a recent systematic review, Jeong et al (2021) found that parenting programs across LMICs can significantly improve a range of parental and early childhood outcomes for children ages 0-3. The 41 studies from 19 LMICs suggested that these programs had positive impacts on child language, cognitive, motor, socio-emotional and development, attachment to caregivers, a reduction in behavioral problems; and improved parenting practices, parent-child interactions, and parental knowledge.40 Implementation models for parenting programs that achieved positive impact varied from group parenting sessions, home visits, or a combination of the two, demonstrating it is possible to improve outcomes through different modalities.  Parenting programs with explicit content on responsive caregiving had greater impacts on the cognitive development of children, parenting knowledge and practices, and parent-child interactions than programs that did not have explicit content on responsive caregiving", "Similarity Score": 0.7210330963134766}

Even in a positive policy context, social stigma, poverty, and other challenges will still present obstacles. In a study with adolescent mothers in Mahama refugee camp in Rwanda, for example, researchers found that even though girls are encouraged to remain in school as long as their health and the health of the child is not jeopardized, the majority of adolescent mothers are not in school due to the social stigma associated with young pregnancy.23 Targeting adolescent parents for intervention will include some of the youngest children at the greatest risk for poor development outcomes. In addition, it can build on recent advances in research on adolescence and growing recognition that this can be an important point for intervention, as the period of adolescence might present possibilities for recovery from early-life adversity.24  As described in new work by Weurmli, Yoshikawa, and Hastings (2021)25 viewing adolescent pregnancy through a dual-generational lens, in which outcomes for both parents and their children are considered, could be one of the most powerful applications of dual generation theory as it presents the opportunity to capitalize on two of the most sensitive periods of human development: early childhood and adolescence", "Similarity Score": 0.7203508019447327}

Promising research from contexts of forced displacement and post-conflict LMICS suggests that parenting programs can directly target the well-being of caregivers and lead to improved outcomes for both caregivers and their children. Parental mental health and wellbeing can buffer a child from experiencing the worst effects of exposure to conflict and displacement.47 Beginning in utero, maternal stress and depression can significantly affect key domains of child development such as growth, nutrition, socio-emotional and cognitive development.48 Maintaining or improving maternal wellbeing is a key pathway to promoting nurturing care and holistic early childhood development and is a prime example of a two-generation approach to early childhood development.  Research has shown that it is possible to improve maternal wellbeing outcomes through early childhood development programming; many programs have had significant positive impacts on maternal wellbeing and mental health.

Niemesh, and Melissa Thomasson\nNBER Working Paper No. 23263\nMarch 2017\nJEL No. I19,J11,N32\nABSTRACT\nAccurate vital statistics are required to understand the evolution of racial disparities in infant \nhealth  and the causes of rapid secular decline in infant mortality during the early twentieth \ncentury. Unfortunately,  infant mortality rates prior to 1950 suffer from an upward bias stemming \nfrom a severe underregistration  of births. At one extreme, African-American births in Southern \nstates went unregistered at the rate  of 15 to 25 percent. In this paper, we construct improved \nestimates of births and infant mortality in the United States for the 1915-1940 period using \nrecently released complete count decennial census microdata combined with the counts of infant \ndeaths from published sources.

Research in Mexico found that a group-based parenting education program, while effective overall, did not improve outcomes for the children of women who began childbearing when they were adolescents.63 The researchers recognized that little is known about how to improve parenting behaviors and development outcomes for adolescent parents,64 and hypothesized that general parenting programs might not adequately or effectively address the unique needs of young mothers. They highlight the need for research to focus on this specific population and to investigate drivers of effectiveness and why there might be differential effects. A good example, and one of the only studies to evaluate a program focused on adolescents is from Chile, where researchers evaluated the effects of home visits from a paraprofessional to adolescent mothers.65 While they found positive initial effects, these faded out in the medium term, suggesting the importance of regular visits to prevent fadeout.  Conclusion Forcibly displaced children ages 0-3 and adolescent caregivers are among the world\u2019s most vulnerable, underserved, and under researched populations of children and caregivers.

Adolescent pregnancy has become even more common during the Covid-19 pandemic; it is estimated that 1.041 million additional girls are at risk for adolescent pregnancy. 15  Research has found that by the time a child is 4 \u00bd years old, having an adolescent mother is associated with compromised development across several domains.16 Children of adolescent mothers are also observed to have worse long-term outcomes, such as worse health, less schooling and lower earnings, and have an elevated risk of becoming adolescent parents themselves.17 Analysis of the underlying mechanisms of these associations suggests that much of the negative relationship between adolescent motherhood and child outcomes can be explained by the mothers\u2019 socioeconomic status, as the lives of adolescent parents are often defined by poverty", "Similarity Score": 0.6996829509735107}

In these early years, the architecture of the brain is formed, which provides a child with the life-long foundation for future learning, health, and behavior.30 In this period children are particularly sensitive to social interaction, environmental influence, and external threats to development.31 Without timely intervention, adverse threats to children\u2019s development can lead to life-long challenges related to physical and mental health, learning, behavior, and employment. Additionally, the impact of adverse childhood experiences can be cumulative; the more adverse the experiences to which a child is exposed, the greater the likelihood of long-term effects on outcomes such as substance abuse, depression, heart disease, poor academic achievement, and early death.32 In children\u2019s earliest years, responsive caregiving from parents or primary caregivers is a critical part of the nurturing care that enables children healthy developmental progression. These positive interactions can also buffer a child from the potential negative impacts of adversity and stress.33  Maternal-child attachment in particular is critical for optimal early childhood development, and in the face of adversity, maternal-child attachment and maternal psychological wellbeing are critical protective factors for children\u2019s wellbeing and development", "Similarity Score": 0.6866030693054199}

When does underregistration bias matter?\nIn general, IMR di\u000berentials and treatment e\u000bect estimates are biased to the extent that un-\nderregistration is correlated with the intervention or group attribute. Answering this question is\nsimpli\fed if we consider three scenarios. First, sometimes the researcher would like to know the\ntrue IMR for a given place and time without making any comparisons. In this simple scenario, any\nunderregistration of births will bias the estimate of IMR. Secondly, researchers frequently make\ncomparisons across locations, groups, or time. IMR di\u000berences arising from a cross-sectional com-\nparison partially reduce the bias as long the extent of underregistration remains constant across\nthe groups being compared. However, underregistration appears to vary in important ways across\ngroups and locations (e.g. higher bias in the IMR for blacks and in southern states). Later, we\nprovide two applications of cross-sectional comparisons where this bias can dramatically change\n16The proportion of births registered clearly varies over time within a state. A simple way to argue the point is to notice\nthe large di\u000berences in registration rates by whether the birth occurred in a hospital, and that the proportion of hospital births\nincreased rapidly over time. The 1940 test showed that 98.5 percent of all hospital births were registered versus 86", "Similarity Score": 0.6864776015281677}

The significance of adolescence has traditionally been associated with rapid growth in physical, cognitive, and psychosocial domains as children enter puberty and often experience changes in relation to their education, work, sexual activity, identity, and relationships.9 More recently, the period of adolescence has also been recognized for its significance to the development of the brain.10 During this time, the brain\u2019s structure and function changes through the increased ability of neural networks to grow and reorganize. Moreover, during this period, adolescents are particularly prone to experience heightened levels of extreme stress and emotional reactivity.11 Theory and research in the fields of cognitive science, psychology, and neuroscience have each drawn attention to the importance of adolescence as a critical period of development.  Adolescence, accordingly, like early childhood, is a time of heightened sensitivity to environmental influence.  5 Innovations for Poverty Action | poverty-action.org This sensitivity makes adolescence both an opportunity for intervention, in that programs might be able to effect lasting change, and a point of vulnerability, as adolescents are more likely to be sensitive to stress compared to adult women and the effects of negative experiences such as stress might be similarly long-lasting", "Similarity Score": 0.6480912566184998}
