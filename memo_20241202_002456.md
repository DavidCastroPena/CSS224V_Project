**Detailed Findings:**

* **Measuring Financial Inclusion:**  The Global Findex data reveals significant disparities in financial inclusion globally and within countries, with wealthier individuals having greater access.  Account ownership doesn't guarantee usage, and informal financial practices remain prevalent. Methodological limitations include reliance on self-reported data and cross-sectional analysis.

* **Digital Financial Services:**  A review of randomized controlled trials shows that digital financial services positively impact financial inclusion, particularly for marginalized groups. However, challenges include overborrowing, consumer protection, and addressing gender gaps.

* **Bank Expansion in India:**  Bank expansion in India primarily benefited existing firms, with limited impact on new firms or innovation.  The study used a rigorous regression discontinuity design to minimize selection bias. Heterogeneous effects were observed across firm sizes and regions.

* **Gender Gap in Mobile Banking:**  Targeted interventions can narrow gender gaps in mobile banking usage, but broader technology impacts still show persistent gender disparities.  Challenges for female migrants included lower income, cultural barriers, and access to technology.

* **Inclusive Finance in Indonesia:**  The Indonesian context highlights the need for improved infrastructure, technology, and coordination to achieve financial inclusion goals.  The study uses various datasets but faces limitations due to self-reported data and correlational analysis.


**Recommendations:**

Based on the reviewed research, the following recommendations are proposed to foster financial inclusion for women substance users in San Francisco's Mission District:

1. **Targeted Digital Financial Literacy Programs:** Implement programs specifically designed for women substance users, addressing their unique needs and challenges.  These programs should focus on practical financial skills, budgeting, and responsible use of digital financial services.  Consider partnering with existing substance abuse treatment centers and community organizations.

2. **Accessible and Affordable Digital Financial Services:**  Ensure easy access to affordable digital financial services, including mobile banking and online payment systems.  Address potential barriers such as lack of reliable internet access, smartphone ownership, and digital literacy.  Explore partnerships with mobile providers and financial institutions to offer subsidized services.

3. **Support for Entrepreneurship:**  Develop programs that support women substance users in starting and growing their own businesses.  This could include micro-loans, business training, and mentorship opportunities.  Consider tailoring these programs to the specific needs and challenges faced by this population.

4. **Consumer Protection Measures:**  Implement robust consumer protection measures to safeguard women substance users from predatory lending practices and financial exploitation.  This could include education on consumer rights, access to financial counseling, and collaboration with regulatory bodies.

5. **Gender-Specific Interventions:**  Design interventions that address the specific challenges faced by women substance users, such as gender-based violence, discrimination, and lack of social support.  Partner with organizations specializing in gender-based violence and women's empowerment.

6. **Evaluation and Monitoring:**  Regularly evaluate the effectiveness of the implemented policies and programs using appropriate metrics.  This will allow for adjustments and improvements based on real-world outcomes.  Consider using both quantitative and qualitative data collection methods.
