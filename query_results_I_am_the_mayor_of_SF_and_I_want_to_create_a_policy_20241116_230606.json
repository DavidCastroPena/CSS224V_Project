A lot of finances going into \nthings like that because of the opportunities, such a big of a pie as you were saying that \nis available.  \n  My first question is how are banks making money out of this?  If there \nare accounts that are dormant, they're still providing that service.  How -- what is their \nown incentive as a private sector to expand into this bottom of the pyramid co mmunities \nin developing countries and in emerging markets?  \n  And then the second one is when you have such positive outlooks and a \nlot of profit to be made, you usually have offshoots.

But the reality is that \ncertainly from a policy perspective, in fostering the growth of this industry and furthering \nfinancial inclusion involves multiple levels of government and involvement.  And we can't \nforget that.   \n  So a government might make a commitment to financial inclusion, but if \nit's only the financial regulator, they aren't the ones who are responsible for customer IDs \nin that country.  There are multiple agencies that come up with customer IDs.  There \nneeds to be broad coordination between all those players.  \n  Let's not forget that in many countries in the Middle East and North \nAfrica, other government departments have guardianship laws that prevent women from \nopening up their own bank account without, you  know, the permission of a male relative.  \nSo if we don't deal with those folks, then all these other great initiatives are not going to \nget anywhere.  And then, of course, to Leora's point about all the different ways that \nthese services can be used for e ducation, energy, all sorts of things.  So we mustn't \nforget that this is not just about talking to the finance guy; it cuts across all areas of a \ncountry's policymaking environment.  \n  MR. DONNAN:  That's a really interesting point that's made in the repor t.  \nActually, key point four of that need for coordination",

We're certainly not the fi rst to recognize \nthis.  It's well recognized that there's a persistent and significant gender gap under which \nwomen are often more -- significantly more excluded from access to formal financial \nservices than men.  And, of course, you cannot have full finan cial inclusion unless you \nhave financial inclusion for everybody, including women.  And so closing that gender gap, \nwhich unfortunately has not significantly appeared to close in the last couple of years in \ngeneral is something that is really, really impor tant. \n  And the other final point I'll mention here is that it's also important to \naccount for diverse cultural contexts",
