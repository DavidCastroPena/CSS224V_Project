Indian policies on rural f inance have mirrored the worldwide \npattern since the 1950s with the implementation of various forms of subsidised credit schemes, \nincluding the mammoth Integrated Rural Development Programme (IRDP). The basis of extending \nsubsidised credit is the theory in  development economics which claims that access to capital can lead \nto increased income and reduced poverty. The critical assumption of that model is that all households \nhave a project to invest in and it is only the lack of collateral that prevents banks from lending to the \npoor. It was exactly this fundamental logic which led to the innovation of different kinds of collateral \nsubstitutes like joint liability which formed the basis for the microcredit revolution worldwide, \nparticularly in South Asia.  \nHowe ver, it is now well recognized that financial needs of the \u2018excluded\u2019 segments of the economy go \nbeyond access to credit.

This result raises the\nquestion of whether governments should also implement simultaneous labor-oriented policies\nin order to reap the full benefit of formal financial market policies.\n43. A notable exception is Cagetti and De Nardi (2006) who allows individuals to have different productivity\nas workers and entrepreneurs, but focus on wealth inequality.\n44. The fact that a large part of the Gini index of total income is explained by wages in the aggregate is not\nthat surprising since, in Brazil, over 72% of the population are employees and not entrepreneurs. This high\nfraction confirms that understanding the drivers of wage inequality among employees is an important avenue\nfor better understanding how financing frictions affect aggregate inequality.\n48The importance of financial inclusion also has potential implications for current and future\npolicy on digital banking. Such policies are already underway in some developing countries\nwith the goal of expanding financial access, including in Brazil with the launch of an instant\npayment platform (Pix) and its mandatory use by all financial institutions and payment\ninstitutions that are licensed by the Central Bank of Brazil. This initiative, by improving\ndeposit provisions and lowering costs of access to liquidity services, should boost development\nand firm growth, particularly in tradable industries",

The poor in \ndeveloping countries like India, face three main issues or a \u2018triple  whammy\u2019 \u2014 low incomes, lack of \nappropriate financial tools, and unpredictable outcomes. It is these challenges which financial Advancing Financial Inclusion in India beyond the Jan -Dhan Yojana  \n  \n \n6 \n inclusion initiatives must address. This research found three main areas where poor households would \nfrequently find the need to  generate resources through financial tools . \nLump sums of cash : In order to invest in microenterprises and agricultural activities, the poor need to \ngenerate large sums of money to purchase fertilizers or invest in human capital such as healthcare, \nschool fees and weddings. However, there are constraints on the ability to generate such large sums. \nHence, they require financial instruments that meet these needs by helping them \u2018save up\u2019 to a lump \nsum amount.  \nDaily expenditure : Funding for day -to-day expendi ture is a need that the poor face, and is often \nunaddressed by the financial institutions, unlike the provision of lump sum of money. This need is \nmost acute for those farmers who receive a few lump sums over the year. However, these sums of \nmoney are almo st immediately used up. There is a need to set some money aside in the months of no \nincome and also for future expenditure. This need is also important for other categories of workers \nwho receive intermittent income, like daily labourers, in order to bridg e gaps in earnings",

First, bank expansion can foster local demand either because it relaxes indi-\nviduals\u2019 borrowing constraints and reduces their need for precautionary savings, or because\nthe opening of a bank branch functioned as fiscal stimulus.29\nSecond, bank expansion can foster supply by reducing investment frictions, thereby boost-\ning investment of existing firms and facilitating the entry of new firms. In this case, the\ndifferential dependence on local demand should not matter and we expect both tradable and\nnon-tradable industries to benefit from the reform.\n5.2.1 Consumption vs. business development channel\nTo test if most of the effect is coming from a bank-expansion-induced increase in demand,\nwe decompose growth in aggregate employment at the city level by firms in non-tradable\nvs. tradable industries. Indeed, since non-tradable industries are more dependent on local\ndemand than tradable industries\u2014because, by definition, tradable industries produce goods\n29. Financial inclusion will reduce the need of precautionary savings for instance because of limited insurance\nin developing countries.\n26that can be sold across the whole country, if not worldwide\u2014an increase in local demand\ndriven by the reform should benefit non-tradable industries relatively more.\nTo do so, we estimate equation (2) and split the regression between tradable and non-\ntradable, which requires us to work at the city-industry level",

(ii) Despite the use of a matching procedure, the variable we use\nto sort cities into treatment and control groups\u2014the presence of a government-controlled\nbank\u2014might still be correlated with other city-level characteristics that make treated units\nmore sensitive to aggregate shocks post 2004. We discuss how we address both of these\nconcerns below.\n(i) Treated-specific ex-post shocks. Even with perfect ex-ante covariate balance between\ntreated and control cities, the estimated effect of promoting financial inclusion on city-level\noutcomes could be biased if this policy correlates with other unobserved shocks that specifi-\ncally affect cities that received the treatment. This is a concern in a setting where no city has\na bank and identification is achieved by bank entry in some cities and not others. However, it\nis important to emphasize that our setting is conceptually different. By construction, public\nbanks are present in all control cities prior to the reform. Therefore, any bank-specific shock\nafter 2004 will affect both treated and control cities.\nThis setting therefore directly addresses two standard concerns about empirical designs\nfeaturing bank entry",
