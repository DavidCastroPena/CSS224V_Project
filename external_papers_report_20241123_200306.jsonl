Globally, the infant mortality rate decreased from 6300 deaths per 100,000 live births in 1990 to 3500 deaths per 100,000 live births in 2012 [1]. Correspondingly, the infant mortality rate of the United States (US) declined from approximately 10,000 infant deaths per 100,000 live births in 1900, to 689 infant deaths per 100,000 live births in 2000 [2]. However, the US rate is still largely above those of most other developed countries, which has attracted attention among researchers and public policy makers. Infant mortality is associated with a variety of factors such as maternal health, socioeconomic conditions, and public health practices. The high US infant mortality has some association with and may be attributable in large part to disparities in socioeconomic status which in turn are associated with race and ethnicity. Considerable differences in socioeconomic status and resulting financial disempowerment may adversely affect food security and nutrition, education, and health care in local and regional communities. Thus, the long-term pattern of mortality in the US has shown inconsistency for socioeconomic and demographic subgroups of the population as well as causes of infant death", "Similarity Score": 0.7604930996894836, "URL": "https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph120504908"}
