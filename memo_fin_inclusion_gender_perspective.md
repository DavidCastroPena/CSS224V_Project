| MEASURING PROGRESS ON FINANCIAL AND DIGITAL INCLUSION | Washington, D.C.                                     | August, 2015              | Full financial inclusion cannot be achieved without addressing the gender gap. Women are often significantly more excluded from access to formal financial services than men. | The research used a scorecard to measure financial inclusion across four dimensions: country commitment, mobile capacity, regulatory environment, and adoption. Data was drawn from sources like the World Bank's Global Findex. |  |

| TOWARDS INCLUSIVE DIGITAL FINANCE IN INDONESIA | Indonesia                                            | None                       | In Indonesia, qualitative research suggests gender norms governing financial and household decision-making are less restrictive compared to other LMICs; women often have control and authority over household finances (Manderson, 1983), regardless of their own contribution to the householdâ€™s income (Papanek and Schwede, 1988).  Analysis of self-reported involvement in financial decision-making using the 2018 FII data is in line with these findings. Across the board, married women are more likely to report having a dominant role in financial decisions, as compared to married men. In addition, married women are substantially more engaged than unmarried women. | The research draws on a literature review, policy analyses, interviews with over forty key stakeholders in the public and private sectors, and analysis of four datasets: (1) the 2018 Financial Inclusion Insights survey (FII); (2) the 2019 National Socioeconomic Survey (SUSENAS); (3) the 2017 Survey on Financial Inclusion and Access (SOFIA); and (4) the 2018 Village Potential Statistics (PODES).  A machine learning algorithm called random forest was used to identify background characteristics most strongly related to financial inclusion. | None |

    *   The methodology involved using Brazilian administrative data and a difference-in-differences research design, comparing cities impacted by the policy to those that were not.
    *   The study's conclusions of positive economic impacts diverge from some previous research in developing countries, potentially due to the scale of the policy, the longer time frame, and the comprehensive data used.

**Policy Recommendations**

While the research provides a broad overview of financial inclusion and gender, further research is needed to tailor interventions to the specific needs of women substance users in the Mission District.  However, based on the available information, the following preliminary recommendations are suggested:

*   **Needs Assessment:** Conduct a thorough needs assessment to understand the specific financial challenges faced by this population, including access to banking services, credit, and financial literacy programs.
*   **Targeted Interventions:** Design interventions that address the unique needs identified in the needs assessment. This could include specialized financial literacy programs, access to microloans, and support for opening bank accounts.
*   **Partnerships:** Collaborate with local organizations serving this population to ensure effective outreach and service delivery.
*   **Gender-Sensitive Approach:**  Recognize and address the specific barriers women substance users face, considering the intersection of gender and substance use.
*   **Data Collection and Evaluation:** Implement a robust data collection and evaluation framework to track the effectiveness of the interventions and make adjustments as needed.

By implementing these recommendations, San Francisco can take meaningful steps towards fostering financial inclusion for women substance users in the Mission District.
