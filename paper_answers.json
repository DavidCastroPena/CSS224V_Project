The study used administrative records from November 2013 to August 2015, providing transaction-level data on deposits and withdrawals.  A household survey conducted between April and May 2016 collected information on trust, savings behavior, and financial knowledge.  Regression analysis was used to assess the impact of the intervention on trust, account use, and savings, with standard errors clustered at the village level to account for intra-cluster correlation.",

However, unlike some other studies, the increase in savings was not associated with increased financial literacy.",

Further research is needed to determine which specific messages and activities within these interventions are most effective.",

These activities significantly increased participants' trust in banks and led to a substantial increase in savings over a 10-month period.",

However, the increase in usage didn't translate into similar increases in digital remittances.

The first experiment focused on individual training, while the second incorporated family networks.  The individual training significantly increased bKash usage among women, but the family network experiment showed only a modest increase in adoption, with limited impact on remittance behavior.  This suggests that while training is effective, addressing social and economic factors influencing remittance behavior is crucial.",

However, due to limited sample size, the results were exploratory.  The findings suggest that incorporating family networks might positively influence adoption among female migrants, but more research is needed to determine the impact of factors like group composition and treatment intensity."
