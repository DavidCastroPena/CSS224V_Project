The RD design helps address concerns about unmeasured family characteristics that might confound the relationship between Head Start participation and outcomes.

While some studies have shown positive short-term effects, this study provides evidence of longer-term positive impacts on both health and education, particularly for Black children, which contrasts with some previous findings.
