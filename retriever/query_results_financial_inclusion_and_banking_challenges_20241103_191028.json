Bank branch\nproximity mitigates the transaction costs of mobilizing savings from many agents, which\ncan increase the capital available to entrepreneurs. Branch proximity also lowers the cost to\nbanks of screening and monitoring entrepreneurs, and of providing access to liquidity services.\nHowever, setting up bank branches is not only costly but also risky, as demand for deposits\nand loans can only be observed after the creation of the branch, which can lead to an under-\nprovision of financial services.\nFor this reason, policymakers across the world have sought to promote financial inclu-\nsion by implementing large-scale reforms to expand the physical networks of bank branches.1\nThe popularity of these financial inclusion policies raises multiple questions: do they suc-\nceed in promoting financial and economic development and, if so, how? And what are the\ndistributional consequences of such policies?\nIn this paper, we trace out the dynamic effects on both economic development and wage\ninequality of a government program that improved access to mainstream financial services.\nWe use the introduction of the \u201cBanks for All\u201d program ( \u201cBanco para Todos\u201d ) by the Brazil-\nian federal government in 2004, which explicitly targeted underbanked cities by introducing\nbranches of government-owned banks",
