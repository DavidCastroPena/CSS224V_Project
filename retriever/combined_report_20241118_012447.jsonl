For instance, savings and micro-\n\ufb01nance has been shown to foster the creation of micro-enterprises (Du\ufb02o et al., 2013, Dupas\nand Jonathan, 2013), and savings and borrowing groups contribute to consumption smoothing\n(Beaman et al., 2014, Ksoll and Forskningsenhed, 2013). The critical question of whether access\nto \ufb01nancial services would be bene\ufb01cial to the very poorest and most vulnerable in a commu-\nnity remains. This is of critical importance in a context where \ufb01nancial services are quickly\nspreading to the better-o\ufb00 members of a community, and possibly hurting the poorest members\nthrough negative spillovers through reduced \ufb01nancial transfers (Lingon et al., 2002), changes in\nthe structure of \ufb01nancial networks (Comola and Prina, 2014), or from over indebtedness (Karim,\n2011).\nIn this paper, we study the ability of savings and borrowing groups (SBGs) to bring \ufb01nancial\ninclusion to poor vulnerable households who are usually not reached by traditional banking\nor micro\ufb01nance interventions.1SBGs are spreading extremely fast in sub-Saharan Africa and\nelsewhere. In 2014, an estimated 10.5 millions households are members of SBGs, a tenfold\nincrease relative to 2008", "similarity": 0.751809298992157}

This concern arises because well-functioning SBGs require a membership\nthat is able to save, to borrow, to utilize the borrowed funds, and to repay the group. In order\nto gauge whether these groups are e\ufb00ective vehicles of \ufb01nancial inclusion, it is thus important to\nunderstand whether the poorest carry out these functions in a di\ufb00erent way than the non-poor,\nand whether these di\ufb00erences a\ufb00ect the performance of the group.\nIn the \ufb01rst part of the paper, we build a theoretical model representing the functioning of a\nSBG. We use the model to study how the propensity to save and borrow of the group\u2019s members\nshape the individual saving and borrowing decisions, as well as the collective performance of\nthe group. The kind of group we are interested in modeling is commonly found in sub-Saharan\nAfrica. SBGs are typically composed of twenty to thirty members who save and borrow from\nthe group. Individual savings are accumulated on a weekly basis in a common pool stored in a\nsafe box, and lent out to requesting members over a year-long operating cycle. Loans are paid\nback to the group with interest, which is set at the beginning of the cycle", "similarity": 0.7507345080375671}

However, it is still unclear whether\nSBGs are also useful in fostering the \ufb01nancial inclusion of the poorest members of local communities. In\nthis paper, we develop a model of SBG.

We argue that including a person with a\nlow ability to save imposes a negative externality on the group when the funds available to the group are\nscarce, and a positive externality when funds are in excess of the demand for loans. We test the model\nusing data from an evaluation of a \ufb01nancial inclusion program in rural Uganda, where we exogenously\nchanged the proportion of vulnerable participants with low ability to save in some newly created groups.\nWe show that having members with a greater propensity to save increases borrowing from other members\nof the group", "similarity": 0.7471541166305542}

In the presence of\nwithin-village spillovers from savings groups, this could di\ufb00erentially in\ufb02uence the decision to\nsave or to borrow of pre-selected participants. For instance, if VSLA participants are conduits\nof loanable funds to the rest of the community, the larger number of participants involved in\nsavings groups in sparse villages could potentially reduce the average amount of funds borrowed\nin those groups. However, it is important to remember that SCORE created many additional\nnon-study SBG in the study areas. In addition, other non-SCORE SBGs are operating in most\nvillages. Using data from a census of SBGs carried out after our study groups were established,\nwe show that the total number of SBGs is not statistically di\ufb00erent between dense and sparse\nareas.

In Pakistan, Gine and Mansuri (2014) randomized\nthe amount of the loan through a lottery, but power issues prevent them from saying much about\nthe impact of obtaining this additional amount of credit.\nOverall, the mix of results from these RCTs suggest that while there is demand for more\ncredit, even at high costs, it is unclear how greater access translates into better economic out-\ncomes for credit recipients. In this paper, we try to understand why this may be the case, using\nadministrative data to explore how gaining access to credit may have negative impacts on bene\ufb01-\nciaries, something that these other studies were unable to look at in detail.

Banks who wish to help new clients gain access to \ufb01nan-\ncial markets are, however, often faced with limited information about these individuals, leading\nthem to seek alternative mechanisms to allocate credit. What is the consequences of offering typ-\nically excluded populations access to credit through an alternative selection mechanism? Would\nit help them integrate in the credit market or lead them to higher indebtedness? Would they be\nbetter or worse off?\nWhile various studies have looked at how the entrance of new competitors in a market,\nparticularly micro\ufb01nance institutions, impact the welfare of potential recipients, few studies have\nfocused on the impact of access to credit at the individual borrower level. In this paper, we take\nadvantage of the fact that a formal bank in Paraguay developed a credit product targeting an\nunderserved population and determined loan eligibility based on a strict assignment rule", "similarity": 0.7317253947257996}

We begin by showing that individuals who were deemed just eligible for\na loan were more likely to accept the loan offer from Banco Familiar. That is, we have a valid\n\ufb01rst stage. We show, in Figure 4, that nobody who was non-eligible received a loan from Banco\nFamiliar. The portion of eligible applicants who took the loan is close to 70 percent. Formally,\nwe \ufb01nd an effect of being just eligible for a loan of 46 percent on the probability of taking out a\nloan with Banco Familiar when estimating it with Equation (1).\nThis loan product was relatively popular, unlike the one evaluated by Arr\u00e1iz et al. (2019) in\nthat different types of clients seem to have taken the loan at similar rates. Thus, the introduc-\ntion of this new screening tool did not, in this context, lead to adverse selection like in theirs.\nFormally, Appendix Table A.1 shows the rate of loan acceptance by applicants\u2019 characteristics.\nThe \ufb01rst panel separates individuals by the credit score reported by Equifax at the moment of\ntheir application to Credicedula.

Using a regression discontinuity framework, we then measured the impact of\nbeing deemed just eligible for a loan, irrespective of whether the client accepted the offer or not,\n1The range of the predicted probability of default was between 0.1 and 0.5. We are thus focusing on individuals\nvery similar in terms of the bank\u2019s scoring system (within the 0.192-0.2 range; 0.004 above and below the 0.196 cut-off).\n2The credit bureau in Paraguay has a large number of institutions reporting to it.

We see no change in the number of requests from other banks suggesting that, un-\nfortunately, this loan from Banco Familiar did not help these individuals increase their access to\nthe most valued institutions in the credit market. However, we do see a strong impact on requests\nfrom \ufb01nance companies and cooperatives. This suggests that Credicedula led individuals to gain\naccess to other formal loans that are similar or better in terms of interest rates, as discussed\nearlier. The effect does not dissipate in the longer-run for \ufb01nance companies and cooperatives.\nWe \ufb01nd no aggregate impact on information requests from retail-linked institutions, but do see\na small impact in the short-run. Individuals may have used their Credicedula loan to purchase\ndurable goods which they also partially \ufb01nanced with store credit. The fact that this appears to\ndissipate quickly suggests that individuals did not resort to that type of expensive credit in the\nlonger-term, something that appears to be positive for the applicants. Finally, we see small but\npositive impacts of becoming loan eligible on requests coming from moneylenders, which offer\nloans at the highest rates.\n20Table 4.

This suggests that despite the fact that credit seems to be available to this population,\naccess to a better type of loan (formal) can improve their \ufb01nancial situation two to three years\ndown the road. The Credicedula loan product was privately pro\ufb01table, suggesting that there is\nroom for the private market to increase services for more marginal clients.\nHowever, our results also suggest that on its own, this screening approach may also give\neligibility to individuals who are locked out of the credit market based on past bad credit be-\nhavior. Thus, this alternative screening mechanism may be most useful when combined with a\nmeasure of how much interaction applicants have had with the credit market. Overall, this is\nan interesting conclusion because it suggests that policies to enhance access to \ufb01nance should\nconsider different approaches based on the depth of individuals\u2019 credit histories to better meet\ntheir needs.

As summarized by Banerjee et\nal. (2015a), experimental studies in general have found limited demand for the new microcredit\nofferings and also limited impacts on consumption, income generation, etc. They also found no\nevidence of negative outcomes. For example, Banerjee et al. (2015b) \ufb01nd that slums in India that\nexperienced bene\ufb01ts from increased access to microcredit for existing businesses through higher\n4investments and pro\ufb01ts, also saw a decrease in temptation goods consumption to the bene\ufb01t of\ndurables.

These \ufb01gures are worse for individuals with lower incomes\nand without credit histories.\nIn 2014, the World Bank published the results of a survey of \ufb01nancial institutions in Paraguay,6\nincluding the interest rates charged by different types of institutions. For example, the average\ninterest rate for commercial bank loans was 19 percent, whereas \ufb01nance companies charged 34\npercent and cooperatives, 24 percent. These are average rates for the entire population; the\nrates obtained by the low-income individuals with limited credit histories included in our study\nmay differ substantially from these averages. In a survey of our target population in Azevedo\net al. (2019), we asked participants about their current credit interest rates by type of lending\ninstitution. We found that banks, moneylenders, and store credit all charged average interest\nrates of about 40 percent. Finance companies charged slightly less at 37 percent, and cooperatives\nwere the cheapest source of credit at 29 percent. The interest rates paid by our respondents also\nvaried greatly. This suggests that switching from current \ufb01nancing sources to cooperatives would\nallow the individuals in our population to lower their interest rates.

What are the\nconsequences of being selected using such an alternative mechanism?\nTo study the impact of offering a loan to individuals in this context, we collaborated with\nBanco Familiar, a formal \ufb01nancial institution in Paraguay that has experience working with tra-\nditionally underserved segments. Speci\ufb01cally, in 2012 the bank deployed a new lending product\nknown as \u201cCredicedula\u201d, with a scoring system specially designed for the unbanked, informal\n1sector population. Risk pro\ufb01les in this new system are constructed independently of credit his-\ntory, giving greater weight to additional variables such as demographics and earnings estimates\naccording to geographical location and economic activity. These variables are generally not in-\ncluded in a typical credit analysis. The information is coarse and categorical in a sense, but it\naims to help reduce the risk associated with clients obtaining their \ufb01rst ever formal loan or \ufb01rst\nformal loan of a given size and maturity. However, this alternative credit scoring approach may\nnot only open the door to credit for individuals without a credit history, but also to individuals\nwho have been locked out of the market because of past negative credit behavior.

It should be noted7 Empirical analysis 27\nthat, if the driving mechanism is indeed the (lack of) within-group social trust, then over the\nlong run we should see the patterns of savings and borrowing reverse. This is because program\nbene\ufb01ciaries are involved in other joint activities under SCORE, and if this leads to more trust\nwithin program bene\ufb01ciaries (Feigenberg, Field, Pande, Rigol, and Sarkar (2014)), the buildup\nis proportionally larger in dense group.\nA second possibility is that members of the savings groups operate as mere depositors for\nother community members\u2019 savings. Given that villages assigned to sparse groups have more\ncommunity members directly involved in a savings group, fewer community members channel\ntheir savings through other VSLA participants. Of course, this channel would arise only if dense\nvillages had fewer savings groups than sparse villages; in reality, we showed that this is not the\ncase.\nSome alternative channels are tougher to separately identify. For instance, cross-group learn-\ning spillovers could increase the savings and borrowing rates in sparse groups. Even absent such\nspillovers, it is possible that vulnerable group members are more con\ufb01dent about the safety of\ntheir own savings in groups with many non-vulnerable.

Crucially, whether this externality\nis positive or negative depends on whether the demand for loans is rationed, that is, whether\nevery person who wishes a loan of a certain size can get it. When there is no rationing, the\nsupply of funds available exceeds the demand for loans, and every additional dollar saved by\none reduces the return on savings for everyone else. This negative externality causes the other\nmembers of the group to reduce their savings. An agent who increases her borrowing from the\ngroup, on the other hand, causes an increase in the equilibrium return on savings, which in turn\nincreases savings by everyone else. However, when the group does not generate enough funds\nto satisfy the demand for loans, the sign of the externalities generated by an increase in savings\nor borrowing are reversed. In this case, additional contributions to the group create a positive\nexternality on potential borrowers, because rationing is eased and more people are able to meet\ntheir borrowing needs, while additional demands for funds create a negative externality as they\nworsen rationing.\nOur theory has important implications for the \ufb01nancial inclusion of the very poor, as the\nmodel suggests that including vulnerable members in a savings group will a\ufb00ect the performance\nof the group and its ability to provide \ufb01nancial services to its members", "similarity": 0.7154031991958618}

We \ufb01nd\nstrong evidence that being deemed just eligible for a loan increases one\u2019s interaction with the for-\nmal \ufb01nancial market, did not in\ufb02uence their level of indebtedness, worsen their credit score but\n32had positive self-reported consequences. This may be because the loan increased the applicants\u2019\ncredibility in the eyes of the credit market or because of applicants became more con\ufb01dent in their\ninteractions with creditors. We \ufb01nd that these results are particularly positive for applicants who\nwere previously unknown by \ufb01nancial entities, where obtaining access to formal credit for the\n\ufb01rst-time opened doors to new opportunities in the \ufb01nancial market without negative impacts\non credit scores or increasing defaults", "similarity": 0.709938645362854}

While part of this outcome may be mechanical, it may be linked to the\nfact that this population had a high probability of late payment and that this was penalized by\nthe credit bureau, despite this loan debt no longer appearing as being unpaid by the time we\nconsulted their \ufb01le. This suggests that offering credit to this population may have increased their\naccess to the \ufb01nancial system, but at the cost of leading some individuals to have worse credit\nrecords.\nFinally, based on a small sample of the individuals (with a slightly larger window of scores)\nwe interviewed to assess self-reported \ufb01nancial well-being, we con\ufb01rm the conclusions obtained\nthrough administrative data. Individuals who were just loan-eligible reported paying less in\ncredit costs, improving their capacity to face shocks, and evaluated their \ufb01nancial position more\npositively two to three years after the loan application. We think this is due to Credicedula of-\nfering lower interest rates than alternative options for applicants at the margin and that these\napplicants appear to have later obtained credit from other \ufb01nance companies and credit cooper-\natives that charged lower rates than the informal moneylenders that they may have previously\nrelied on", "similarity": 0.7086939811706543}

Quite intuitively, when the\nresources within the group are scarce, adding more resources is bene\ufb01cial to the other members\nof the group.

In fact, this is entirely consistent with informal interviews,\nwhich suggest that when funds are scarce, priority is given to those who save more.\nWe can explore and discard other alternatives. One possible explanation is that bene\ufb01ciaries\nare able to save, but their demand for loans is lower than non-bene\ufb01ciaries. If that is the case,\nhaving more preselected participants should reduce the implicit rate of return from savings,\nand everyone should save less. We do not observe this. Another possibility is that potential\nborrowers, unable to get loans of the necessary scale in dense groups, choose to forgo loans. This\ncould occur for instance in cases where investment opportunities are indivisible goods.

That is,\nselection creates a negative incentive to save and borrow.\nIt should be emphasized at this point that there are alternative mechanisms that could be\ndrivingtheresults. Forinstance,indensegroupsthescopeforself-selectionisquitelimited,which\nwould possibly mean that there are fewer pre-existing social connections within those groups.\nThe lower savings rates/borrowing rates might thus be a re\ufb02ection of the lack of embedded trust\nat this early stage.

The \ufb01rst panel in Table 10 shows that only for those with the best initial credit\nreport did the credit score signi\ufb01cantly differ between those just eligible and those not eligible.\nHowever, the magnitudes for the two groups are similar. This may thus be more a re\ufb02ection that\nthose with higher credit scores were able to fall more dramatically, thus increasing the precision\nof the estimate.\nThe next panel separates individuals by previous exposure to the credit market. We \ufb01nd that\napplicants who had more exposure prior to applying for Credicedula ended up with lower credit\nscores after becoming loan eligible. This suggests that the negative effect of the loan on credit\nscores may be concentrated among people who had previously had more interactions with the\ncredit market. Granting a loan to these individuals simply increases their probability of default.\nBut for those who were previously unknown to creditors, the loan does not appear to have had\na negative impact on credit scores.\nWe next separate individuals by employment and \ufb01nd that both formal and informal workers\nsuffered a decrease in their credit scores, with those in the formal sector faring worse. This\nrelates again to the explanation above. Those in the formal sector who were deemed just eligible\nfor the loan probably had a history of poor repayment and therefore giving new credit to these\nindividuals did not improve their \ufb01nancial welfare.

In table 9, the R2of the regression increases dramatically when including IP\n\ufb01xed e\ufb00ect, which implies that a large fraction of the variation in interest rate and share price\ncan be attributed to the IPs.

This is consistent with the hypothesis\nthat the loan offer was particularly useful for applicants with weaker credit records that had been\nrestricting their access to credit markets or that it helped clients who thought they had no credit-\nworthiness update their beliefs positively. Similarly, we \ufb01nd that individuals who had more\nprevious exposure to the credit system at the time of application ended up with higher default\nlevels and worse credit scores two to three years later.

The probability of default estimated by the algorithm ranged from 0.1 to 0.5.\nThe cut-off score of 0.196 was set as the maximum probability of late payment that would still\nguarantee pro\ufb01tability of the product: applicants with higher predicted probabilities were not\noffered a loan. Banco Familiar had previously developed other scoring analysis methodologies,\nbut Credicedula was the \ufb01rst one designed speci\ufb01cally for analysis of independent workers with\nno credit history.\nFigure 1 shows that while the credit score generated by the Credicedula algorithm is pos-\nitively correlated with the score provided by Equifax, the relationship is relatively weak.

Hence, as additional resources are introduced into3 The Economics of a Savings and Borrowing Group: a Theoretical Model 11\nthe group, those who are rationed out increase their borrowing, while those who are not rationed\nout are una\ufb00ected.\nLemma 2. Ifbi;t(R;~Ci;t)>0and either\n\u000fr<R, or\n\u000f\fsu\ufb03ciently low,\nthen constraint 1 holds with equality and therefore\nbi;t(R;~Ci;t) = 3tX\ns=1si;s(R;~Ci;s)\n.\nProof.Suppose that the demand and supply for funds of an agent is such that:\nbi;t<3tX\ns=1si;t:\nClearly, the agent could reduce si;tandbi;tby the same amount, satisfy all constraints (including\nthe aggregate resource constraint), and maintain the same outside investment yi;t. Doing so\nwould reduce the interest payment on loans, but also reduce the end-of-cycle payment from the\ngroup.\nNote, however, that resources can be costlessly transfered from period 1 or 2 to period 3 by\nsetting an appropriate ai;t. Therefore, as long as r>Rthe agent prefers to reduce both si;tand\nbi;tup until constraint 1 is binding or bi;tis zero (and the project is fully self \ufb01nanced).\nFinally, note that when \f= 0, no matter the values of rorR, money in period 3 has no\nvalue, so the agent want to minimize the amount saved with the group", "similarity": 0.6643190979957581}

Simultaneously, financial literacy teaches students how to manage their financial situations and meet their financial responsibilities on time and at the lowest possible cost. Financial literacy will increase their chances of company success and their capacity to manage it efficiently and enhance it.

Banking facilities are not available for many women entrepreneurs particularly those who live in rural locations. The banking sector focuses on opening their branches in the urban areas to get more customers but rural locations also need access to banks. Women entrepreneurs need capital to sustain and grow their businesses. For home-based women entrepreneurs having a bank account is a big step forward. Having access to credit can also assist in enterprise development. More work needs to be done on the credit needs of women entrepreneurs in relation to borrowing needs, payment schedules, the cultural environment, and outcomes to be achieved.\n\nRural-urban location disparity was found in the products and services provided by women entrepreneurs. The share of the women in business activities is low as compared to male counterparts in Pakistan (Zeb and Ihsan, 2020).

{"source": "Does It Matter Where You Live? Rural-Urban Context Among Women Entrepreneurs In Pakistan", "content": "Because these entrepreneurial businesses are informal and small in size, women have no formal set of books of accounts. This might be explained in a couple of ways. Women might lack the education and training needed to maintain formal bookkeeping records. The education has the main role to record proper books of account while the findings of this study reported that more than 40% of the women are not formally educated, which can be one of the reasons. However, their businesses are operating on a small scale and are homo-based that could be another reason of not record their business transactions. Women entrepreneurs might be reluctant to seek the help of other family members since this might compromise business control and autonomy. Women entrepreneurs have power since they recognize the positive contributions that they are making (Jabeen et al., 2020). A study (Gathuru and Rukaria, 2021) conducted in Kenya showed that book keeping skills have a significant effect in order to enhance the effectiveness of financial control. Furthermore, another study in South Africa by (Myeko and Madikane, 2019), conducted personal interviews reported that small businesses did not implement proper record of their business transactions as they do not understand its importance. Finally, formal record keeping might be threatening because it might jeopardize the informal nature of the business that would require registration and paying taxes", "similarity": 0.81456458568573}
