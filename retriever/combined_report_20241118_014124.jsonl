Like the authors, I am interested in understanding the determinants \nof the use of financial products, and I have gained some further insights by focusing on the cross-country behavior of variables at the macro (aggre-\ngate) level. These findings, which I will summarize here, complement the \nauthors\u2019 results.\nThe existing literature allows one to identify four categories of obstacles \nto financial inclusion at the country level, which affect either the demand \nfor or the supply of financial services or both (see Rojas-Su\u00e1rez and  \nGonzales 2010 and Rojas-Su\u00e1rez and Amado forthcoming): socioeconomic \nconstraints, macroeconomic factors, characteristics of the operations of \nthe formal financial system, and institutional deficiencies. Here I will pres-\nent and discuss some simple correlations between these obstacles and one \nof the Global Findex indicators of financial inclusion, namely, the percent-\nage of the adult population with an account at a formal institution.\nWith regard to the first category, it is generally expected that coun-\ntries that score high on indicators of social development, such as access \nto high-quality health and education services, will also enjoy high levels \nof financial inclusion. As discussed by Stijn Claessens (2005), financial \nexclusion is often part of a broader social exclusion, which is related, \namong other factors, to differences in education, type of employment, and \ntraining", "Similarity Score": 0.7474052309989929}

In high-income countries, by contrast, more than half of account hold-\ners withdraw money from their accounts six or more times in a typical \nmonth. ATMs and electronic payment systems (debit cards, electronic \nbill payments, and the like) facilitate access to accounts. Indeed, adults with a formal account in high-income countries report most commonly \nusing ATMs for withdrawals.

Indeed, almost 40 years after Muhammad Yunus \nmade the first microloan\u2014the first of many exciting developments in finan-\ncial services for the poor\u2014only now are we beginning to see concerted \nresearch efforts to map the reach and effect of these tools on households \naround the world.\nCountry-specific micro-level studies have suggested that financial inclu-\nsion today may be much lower than what an informed observer would sup-\npose from the ubiquitous media accounts. For example, recent randomized \ntrials suggest that at best a quarter of households take up available loans \nfrom microfinance institutions in India, Mexico, and Morocco (Banerjee \nand others 2013, Cr\u00e9pon and others 2011, Angelucci, Karlan, and Zinman \n2012).

For example, the paper reported that a large \nfraction of the nonincluded chose not to have a bank account because they \nhad too little money to make it worthwhile.

Indicators and Methodology\nThe Global Findex indicators measure the use of financial services, which is distinct from access to financial services.

The Global Findex data can shed light on the \nlevels and patterns of use of different financial services both globally and \namong different groups, such as poor people, youth, and women. But one \ncannot assume that all those who do not use formal financial services are \nsomehow constrained from participating in the formal financial sector\u2014\naccess and use are not the same thing. The role of policy is to broaden finan-\ncial inclusion to reach those who are excluded because of market failures.\nI.A. Indicators\nThe first set of indicators focuses on the ownership and use of an account \nat a formal financial institution. For most people a formal account serves \nas an entry point into the formal financial sector. Having a formal account \nfacilitates the transfer of wages, remittances, and government payments.

However, because of the \nobstacles, the predicted ratio is only 43 percent.\nThe most important conclusions to be drawn from the table are as \nfollows. First, the degree of social development matters greatly. The low level of social development in developing countries on average, and to \na lesser extent in emerging markets, hampers financial inclusion through \nboth demand and supply factors. Second, only in the developed economies \ndoes the high level of institutional quality at least partly offset the adverse \neffect of bank concentration on financial inclusion (the sum of the implied \ncontributions for the bank concentration variable alone and for the bank concentration \u00d7 rule of law interaction is positive). In contrast, in emerging \nmarkets and other developing countries on average, low institutional qual-ity cannot counteract the financial exclusion effects of bank concentration. \nThird, relative to the other factors, inflation volatility and banking ineffi-\nciencies play smaller roles as obstacles to financial inclusion.\nMy discussion here provides just a taste of the potential uses of the \nGlobal Findex database and is intended as a complement to the authors\u2019 \nanalysis and their ongoing research. The authors are to be congratulated not \nonly for this paper but for their rich research agenda on financial inclusion.\nreFerences For the rojas-su\u00e1rez comment\nAllen, F., A.

Gallup World Poll questions are also used by Betsey Stevenson \nand Justin Wolfers (2008) and by Daniel Sacks, Stevenson, and Wolfers \n(2010) as part of their research to analyze relationships between subjective \nwell-being and income; by Bianca Clausen, Aart Kraay, and Zsolt Nyiri \n(2011) to analyze the relationship between corruption and confidence in \npublic institutions; by Demirg\u00fc\u00e7-Kunt and others (2013) to study changes \nin trust in banks in the wake of the global financial crisis; and by Stevenson \nand Wolfers (2011) to examine trust in institutions over the business cycle.\nAs part of the World Poll, since 2005 Gallup has surveyed about 1,000 \npeople annually in each of up to 157 countries,6 using randomly selected, \nnationally representative samples.7 The target population is the entire \ncivilian, noninstitutionalized population aged 15 and above. Surveys are \nconducted in the major languages of each country.8\nAlthough the results obtained using the Global Findex data are broadly \nconsistent with those of earlier efforts, they differ in some nontrivial ways. Three key differences between the Global Findex and other user-side data \ninvolve the definition of an account and its use, the units of measurement \n6. The worldwide aggregates omit countries for which Gallup excludes more than 20 per-\ncent of the population in the sampling either because of security risks or because the popula-\ntion includes non-Arab expatriates", "Similarity Score": 0.6777856349945068}

First, it is clear from the top panel that the devel-\noped countries are distributed across the whole range of bank concentra-\ntion, and thus little can be said about any differences in concentration \nbetween developed and developing countries (except that the negative rela-\ntionship in the figure is driven by the latter). However, when the bank con-\ncentration variable is adjusted by the quality of institutions (bottom panel), \nmost of the developed economies migrate toward the upper right corner of \nthe scatterplot. For this group of countries as a whole, the relatively high \nlevel of institutional quality seems a more relevant factor than bank con-\ncentration for understanding the behavior of financial inclusion.\nSecond, consider Malaysia and Nicaragua. These two developing coun-\ntries share similar ratios of bank concentration (top panel), but the quality \nof institutions is much higher in Malaysia than in Nicaragua. Therefore, \nwhen bank concentration is adjusted for institutional quality, Malaysia lies \nwell to the right of Nicaragua. This is fully consistent with a higher level of \nfinancial inclusion in the former country than in the latter.\nAlthough correlations such as these provide valuable insights, fully \nunderstanding the obstacles to financial inclusion requires a deeper analy-sis", "Similarity Score": 0.6743395924568176}

These excluded countries are Algeria, Bahrain, the Central African Republic, Madagascar, Qatar, Somalia, and the United Arab Emirates. Iran is also excluded because the data were collected in that country using a methodology inconsistent with that used for other countries (the survey was carried out by phone from Turkey). The exclusion of Iran has a nontrivial effect on regional aggregates because its population is larger and wealthier than the populations of most other countries in the Middle East and North Africa. For example, account penetration in the region is estimated to be 18 percent when Iran \nis excluded, but 33 percent when it is included.\n7. In some countries oversamples are collected in major cities or areas of special inter-\nest. In addition, in some large countries, such as China and Russia, sample sizes of at least \n4,000 are collected.\n8.

{"Source": "Does It Matter Where You Live? Rural-Urban Context Among Women Entrepreneurs In Pakistan", "Content": ". Banking facilities are not available for many women entrepreneurs particularly those who live in rural locations. The banking sector focuses on opening their branches in the urban areas to get more customers but rural locations also need access to banks. Women entrepreneurs need capital to sustain and grow their businesses. For home-based women entrepreneurs having a bank account is a big step forward. Having access to credit can also assist in enterprise development. More work needs to be done on the credit needs of women entrepreneurs in relation to borrowing needs, payment schedules, the cultural environment, and outcomes to be achieved.\n\nRural-urban location disparity was found in the products and services provided by women entrepreneurs. The share of the women in business activities is low as compared to male counterparts in Pakistan (Zeb and Ihsan, 2020). Most of the women entrepreneurs were engaged in cloth business and grocery businesses followed by stitching (tailoring) activities.

{"Source": "Does It Matter Where You Live? Rural-Urban Context Among Women Entrepreneurs In Pakistan", "Content": "Because these entrepreneurial businesses are informal and small in size, women have no formal set of books of accounts. This might be explained in a couple of ways. Women might lack the education and training needed to maintain formal bookkeeping records. The education has the main role to record proper books of account while the findings of this study reported that more than 40% of the women are not formally educated, which can be one of the reasons. However, their businesses are operating on a small scale and are homo-based that could be another reason of not record their business transactions. Women entrepreneurs might be reluctant to seek the help of other family members since this might compromise business control and autonomy. Women entrepreneurs have power since they recognize the positive contributions that they are making (Jabeen et al., 2020). A study (Gathuru and Rukaria, 2021) conducted in Kenya showed that book keeping skills have a significant effect in order to enhance the effectiveness of financial control. Furthermore, another study in South Africa by (Myeko and Madikane, 2019), conducted personal interviews reported that small businesses did not implement proper record of their business transactions as they do not understand its importance. Finally, formal record keeping might be threatening because it might jeopardize the informal nature of the business that would require registration and paying taxes", "Similarity Score": 0.81456458568573, "URL": "https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/8927063/pdf/"}

{"Source": "Digital Financial Inclusion: A Gateway To Sustainable Development", "Content": "To make a living, everyone has to have access to financial services. However, financial exclusion continues to be a significant issue, particularly among the most vulnerable. A vulnerable group refers to people who lack the financial capability, documentation, or the opportunities (economic, physiological, psychological, and cultural) to access financial services [25]. Groups at the risk of financial exclusion are overindebted, homeless, unemployed, women, elderly, migrants, and prison inmates.\n\nThe study related to financial inclusion has been examined in many developing countries [24]. The research discovered a significant disparity in the level of accessibility to formal financial products between the wealthy and underprivileged, sub-urban and city populations, and women and males. The report also claimed the majority of the poorest 40% of people in developing nations lack official accounts and that 35% of new businesses struggle to get bank financing. With nearly all sovereign countries requiring comprehensive integration of inclusive financial security and economic development by 2030, it is critical to close the growing gap between the rich and poor, especially in suburban regions.\n\nA study conducted in Indonesia on the gender dimension in digital financial inclusion showed that women in Indonesia tend to have digital financial inclusion in their daily life [27]", "Similarity Score": 0.7560008764266968, "URL": "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2022.e09766"}
