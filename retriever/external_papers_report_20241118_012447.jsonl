Their lifestyles would be enriched and improved as a result of increased financial knowledge. Simultaneously, financial literacy teaches students how to manage their financial situations and meet their financial responsibilities on time and at the lowest possible cost. Financial literacy will increase their chances of company success and their capacity to manage it efficiently and enhance it. Additionally, students will learn more about saving and investing to diversify their sources of income and adapt to the changing financial environment.

Banking facilities are not available for many women entrepreneurs particularly those who live in rural locations. The banking sector focuses on opening their branches in the urban areas to get more customers but rural locations also need access to banks. Women entrepreneurs need capital to sustain and grow their businesses. For home-based women entrepreneurs having a bank account is a big step forward. Having access to credit can also assist in enterprise development. More work needs to be done on the credit needs of women entrepreneurs in relation to borrowing needs, payment schedules, the cultural environment, and outcomes to be achieved.\n\nRural-urban location disparity was found in the products and services provided by women entrepreneurs. The share of the women in business activities is low as compared to male counterparts in Pakistan (Zeb and Ihsan, 2020). Most of the women entrepreneurs were engaged in cloth business and grocery businesses followed by stitching (tailoring) activities. The significance results for beauticians showed that the urban beauticians have more opportunities to expand their businesses.", "similarity": 0.8212817907333374}
{"source": "Does It Matter Where You Live? Rural-Urban Context Among Women Entrepreneurs In Pakistan", "content": "Because these entrepreneurial businesses are informal and small in size, women have no formal set of books of accounts. This might be explained in a couple of ways. Women might lack the education and training needed to maintain formal bookkeeping records. The education has the main role to record proper books of account while the findings of this study reported that more than 40% of the women are not formally educated, which can be one of the reasons. However, their businesses are operating on a small scale and are homo-based that could be another reason of not record their business transactions. Women entrepreneurs might be reluctant to seek the help of other family members since this might compromise business control and autonomy. Women entrepreneurs have power since they recognize the positive contributions that they are making (Jabeen et al., 2020). A study (Gathuru and Rukaria, 2021) conducted in Kenya showed that book keeping skills have a significant effect in order to enhance the effectiveness of financial control. Furthermore, another study in South Africa by (Myeko and Madikane, 2019), conducted personal interviews reported that small businesses did not implement proper record of their business transactions as they do not understand its importance.
