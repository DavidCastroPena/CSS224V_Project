INTRODUCTION  \nSocial protection  programs have been rapidly evolving worldwide. Today, social protection  programs \ncover about 2.5 billion people. Social protection refers to the wide variety of programs and systems that \naim to provide assistance to low -income and marginalized families  and individuals , insure against shocks, \nbreak poverty traps , help people through the life cycle , and potentially improve social outcomes (e.g. , \nhealth, education, gender equality) .  \n \nThese programs are common  and come in many forms. F or example, more  than 120 low - and middle -\nincome countries run cash transfer programs for poor families, and more than 70 of them run social \npension programs  (both contributory and non -contributory pensions, which will be discussed in depth \nbelow) . In just the past decade, the number of low - and middle -income countries running conditional \ncash transfer programs, which condition benefits on households making human capital investments in \ntheir children, has m ore than doubled (World Bank 2018a)", "article_title": "24", "full_section_title": "", "block_type": "text", "language": "en", "last_edit_date": "2024-01-01", "num_tokens": 259}
{"id": "24_8", "content_string": ". These programs have increasingly taken the \nplace of subsidies of basic commodities, promising increased efficiency and an enhanced ability to both \nredistribute income to the poor, but also to provide needed support to middle -class households.  \n \nThe recent C ovid-19 crisis further expanded social protection policies and is expected to continue to play \na pivotal role in low - and middle -income countries\u2019 strategies in the C ovid recovery and beyond.1 The \ncrisis highlighted the essential role of social protection in ensuring that the poor are not left behind, but \nalso its pivotal role in ensuring that the middle class do es not fall back into poverty \u2014either due to the \nlarge macro shocks that affect the whole economy (e.g., recessions, commodity shocks), or also due to \nindividual shocks (e.g., the death or injury of a main income earner, job loss, etc.).  \n \nThe J -PAL-CID Social Protection Initiative was born out of this strong and growing consensus that social \nprotection policies and systems  are important policy tools to help reduce poverty, improve livelihoods and \ndignity, and protect vulnerable groups (e.g., children, the elderly, minorities). In order to do so, we \nbelieve that programs and policies must be designed to meet the needs of peo ple, and to also ensure that \nevidence on what is effective in meeting these needs helps guide policy design. Thus, the Initiative aims \nto fund new randomized control trials  that: \n1", "article_title": "24", "full_section_title": "", "block_type": "text", "language": "en", "last_edit_date": "2024-01-01", "num_tokens": 307}

Increase rigorous empirical evidence in understudied topics and questions in social protection, \nparticularly in research areas where we both have large evidence gaps, and there are pressing \npolicy needs for answers  \n2. Increase rigorous empirical evidence across different contexts, where different programs and \npolicies may have different effects due to underlying conditions, to ensure more context -specific \nevidence  \n3. Improve our long -run understanding of the impacts of programs and policies, and understand \nhow programs evolve  \n \n \n1 In April 2020, 126 countries introduced or adapted social protection programs as a response to Covid -19 (Gentilini et al. 2021 ). For a full list of social \nprotection programs and jobs responses to Covid -19 see Gentilini et. al. 2021.   \n \nJ-PAL-CID Social Protection Initiative Evidence Review  | povertyactionlab.org  \n 5 4. Improve our knowledge of the causal impact of cross -cutting programs and policies to develop \nmore comprehensive systems that provide protection for individuals at different stages of life \nand provide the right support for people with different needs  \n5. Better understand the political economy around such programs  \n \nTo help diagnose the evidence gaps and provide a foundation and guide for our funding competitions, \nthis evidence review aims to review and synthesize the literature on social protection, providing insight \ninto what we know and what we do not know", "article_title": "24", "full_section_title": "", "block_type": "text", "language": "en", "last_edit_date": "2024-01-01", "num_tokens": 288}

As such , while there is a broad research base on social \nprotection \u2014spanning many countries, contexts, and research methods \u2014given the mandate of the  \nInitiative to fund new randomized  evaluations , we focus much of our review (although not exclusively) \non causal, qu antitative studies  in low - and middle -income countries . It is important to note that we \nbroaden the evidence review beyond randomized trials evidence to quasi -experimental evidence to \nensure that the randomized trials are filling gaps in causal evidence across a range of causal empirical \nmethodologies.   \n \nSince the purpose of this document is to help guide future research funding, in addition to reviewing the \nstate of the literature today, we end each section with a list of key open empirical questions where our \nreview suggests additional new evidence can p lay an important role.  \n \nThe rest of this evidence review is structured as follows. Section 2 discusses the design of social \nassistance programs, including those that are designed with poverty as a primary organizing principle, \nand those that are designed with life -cycle challenges as an organizing principle. Section 3 discusses the \ndesign of social insurance programs. Section 4 discusses cross -cutting design  and implementation  issues \nacross all these programs, including systems for targeting and identifying program beneficiaries, take-up \nissues, gender, and ensuring that assistance gets delivered", "article_title": "24", "full_section_title": "", "block_type": "text", "language": "en", "last_edit_date": "2024-01-01", "num_tokens": 283}

SOCIAL ASSISTANCE  \n2.1: SOCIAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS TO ADDRESS POVERTY  \nIn the sections that follow, we review the evidence on a wide range of social assistance  programs  aimed \nat addressing poverty . We start with the simplest program conceptually \u2014unconditional cash transfers \u2014\nand then organize the subsequent empirical sections based on the key program design choices that one \ncan make beyond this benchmark.  In this section we review a number of general social assistance \nprograms; in the subsequent section, we focus on those programs with specific lifecycle -related features, \nsuch as child and elderly grants, which may also address poverty but do so through focusing on \nparticular populations.  \n \nIn doing so, we focus on whether and how those choices affect well -being in a few  senses: affecting \nfuture income above and beyond the transfer itself (i.e. , by raising wages, or allowing the household to \novercome credit constraints); affecting future taxpaying decisions; changing intra-household allocations \n(e.g", "article_title": "24", "full_section_title": "", "block_type": "text", "language": "en", "last_edit_date": "2024-01-01", "num_tokens": 270}

(2016)  and Ralston, Andrews, and Hsiao (2017) . \nWe also refer interested readers to Perera et al. (2022) , a systematic review of reviews exploring the \nimpact of social protection on gender. Instead, our aim is to capture key themes from the literature  and \nto highlight where additional evidence is needed  for the Initiative . \n \n2.1.1: Unconditional Cash Transfers  \nWe begin by considering the simplest programs: unconditional cash transfers (UCTs). The benchmark \nprogram would be a transfer that, once allocated, is completely unconditional \u2014i.e., a households\u2019 ability \nto receive the transfer does not depend on any action.  \n \nFigure 1 plots the percentage of countries at different income levels with UCTs covering at least 1 \npercent of the population. The figure shows that at the beginning of the period we study (1980) such \nprograms were essentially only found in the wealthiest countries", "article_title": "24", "full_section_title": "", "block_type": "text", "language": "en", "last_edit_date": "2024-01-01", "num_tokens": 300}
{"id": "24_13", "content_string": ". By the end of the period, UCTs have \nbecome much more common \u2014and almost equally likely to be found in rich or poor countries alike. \n \nJ-PAL-CID Social Protection Initiative Evidence Review  | povertyactionlab.org  \n 7  \nSeveral randomized studies directly evaluate the impacts of UCTs, such as t he Haushofer and Shapiro \n(2016; 2018)  and Egger et al. (2019)  studies of the GiveDirectly program in Kenya, or consider it in \ncomparison to other programs, such as  the Baird, McIntosh, and \u00d6zler (2011)  study of transfers in \nMalawi. There are many other non -randomized studies as well; Bastagli et al. (2016)  provide a systematic \nreview of 201 cash transfer studies (25 percent of which are UCTs).  \n \nIn general, these programs find substantial evidence that cash transfers improve different aspects of the \nwelfare of recipient households \u2014consistent with the idea that $1 of cash transfer typically yields $1 of \nbenefits to the recipient household.2 For example, Haushofer and Shapiro (2016)  find that recipients of \ncash transfers in Kenya report increases in self -reported psychological well -being and increases in food \nsecurity, assets, and non -durable expenditures. Many of these effects persist even several years after all \ntransfers ended (Haushofer and Shapiro 2018) . More generally, the systematic review from Bastagli et al. \n(2016)  finds that most cash transfer programs lead to increases in both overall expenditures and food \nexpenditures", "article_title": "24", "full_section_title": "", "block_type": "text", "language": "en", "last_edit_date": "2024-01-01", "num_tokens": 348}
{"id": "24_14", "content_string": ". There is less systematic attention to the incidence of these programs , which is important \nfor welfare considerations .  \n \n \n2 For conceptual issues about evaluating cash transfer programs given that $1 in cash typically yields $1 in benefits to recipi ents, see the discussions in \n(Egger et al. 2019)  and (Banerjee, Hanna, et al. 2022) . FIGURE 1: PERCENTAGE OF COUNTRIES THAT ENACTED UCTS COVERING AT \nLEAST 1% OF THE POPULATION BY INCOME CLASSIFICATION, OVER TIME  \n \n \nNotes: This figure plots the percentage of countries that enacted UCTs covering at least 1% of the population, by each \nyear considered against income classification, following the World Bank\u2019s 2021 income classification thresholds, as \nmeasured by GDP per capita ( in constant 2015 $US). We define UCT as a government -implemented, large -scale program \nthat enforces no conditions on recipients and is means -tested.

See Appendix Table 1 for the exact figures plotted in this chart.  \n \n \n \nJ-PAL-CID Social Protection Initiative Evidence Review  | povertyactionlab.org  \n 8 There has also been less research in the causal literature on the role of social assistance  for those with \ndisabilit y.3 Even programs that are not explicitly aimed at those with disabilit y, such as general -purpose \nUCTs, can have important effects for  people with disability . de Groot et al", "article_title": "24", "full_section_title": "", "block_type": "text", "language": "en", "last_edit_date": "2024-01-01", "num_tokens": 336}

This is  an important  area for future research.  \n \nEffects on adult labor supply. There is substantial focus in policy debates on whether transfers reduce work. \nConceptually,  however,  it is important to note that even if a transfer led a household to reduce labor \nsupply, this in itself is not necessarily a problem from a social welfare perspective. For example, someone \nmay choose to work less in a back -breaking, hard job with a cash tr ansfer to preserve their health or to \nspend time with their children, or simply to not have to spend as many hours toiling a way. Their lives \nmay be improved, and th eir decision to work less  is not necessarily a problem \u2014the decision about how \nto trade off labor vs. the other things one can do with one \u2019s time can be thought of just like another \nconsumption decision . For example, people may differ as to whether they want to work harder, earn \nmore, and live in a nicer home, or work less hard, but live in less nice physical conditions.  \n \nNevertheless, there is substantial interest in this question from a policy perspective, particularly around \nthe political support of these programs, as this is often a key part of the political debate on whether \ntransfers should be made, and how generous t hey should be", "article_title": "24", "full_section_title": "", "block_type": "text", "language": "en", "last_edit_date": "2024-01-01", "num_tokens": 318}
{"id": "24_16", "content_string": ". However, the evidence overwhelmingly \nsuggests that cash transfers \u2014at least how they are designed in low - and middle -income country \nsettings \u2014do not have measurable impacts on labor supply. For example, Banerjee et al. (2017 ) re-\nanalyzed seven  different transfer programs across six countries, all of which were  implemented as \nrandomized trials, and found no detectable impacts of these transfers on hours worked. In their review \npiece, Handa et al. (2018)  showed similar findings on the effect of transfers on work.  \n \nEffects on consumption of so -called \u201ctemptation goods. \u201d A common concern about cash transfers is that people \nmay buy some \u201ctemptation goods, \u201d such as alcohol and tobacco. However, the same arguments that \napply to labor supply apply here: to the extent that households are rationally choosing to consume more \nof these goods, this should not matter. Nonetheless, voters appear to be less enthusiasti c about funding \ntransfer programs if they were to lead to consumption of these goods, either because of fears that these \nchoices reflect short -term temptations (Banerjee and Mullainathan 2010)  rather than rational decisions, \nbecause of intra -household issues (e.g., an addict may grab the funds to fund his or her addiction), or \nsimply because voters disapprove of these goods.  \n \nNonetheless, time and time again, researchers observe little effect of cash transfers on consumption of \nthese types of goods", "article_title": "24", "full_section_title": "", "block_type": "text", "language": "en", "last_edit_date": "2024-01-01", "num_tokens": 313}
{"id": "24_17", "content_string": ". A systematic review by Evans and Popova (2016)  examines nineteen  cash transfer \nstudies (a mix of  unconditional and conditional transfers ), and finds no evidence that cash transfers \nincrease expenditures on these goods.  \n \nEffects on investment and future incomes. Many households in low - and middle -income countries are credit -\nconstrained, and many are not able to make investments that could have productive returns (e.g., \nBanerjee and Duflo 2010) . In this case, transfers may have effects beyond themselves if households are \n \n \n3 We discuss disability insurance below in Section 3.1.2.  \n \nJ-PAL-CID Social Protection Initiative Evidence Review  | povertyactionlab.org  \n 9 able to use this to take advantage of productive investments.  \n \nIndeed, there are a number of studies that suggest that households use cash transfers to make future \ninvestments. Gertler, Martinez, and Rubio -Codina (2012)  study the Oportunidades cash transfer \nprogram in Mexico and find that households consume 74 percent of the transfer received and invest the \nrest.4 They then compare households who were treated eighteen  months earlier rather than later, and find \nthat those treated earlier have higher incomes, even four years later. They interpret this as a return on the \nextra eighteen  months\u2019 worth of investments these early -treated households had, compared to the later -\ntreated households", "article_title": "24", "full_section_title": "", "block_type": "text", "language": "en", "last_edit_date": "2024-01-01", "num_tokens": 297}
{"id": "24_18", "content_string": ".  \n \nHow should this sort of investment be valued from a welfare perspective? Consider the Gertler, \nMartinez, and Rubio -Codina (2012)  case. One approach is to assume households are optimizing to begin \nwith, and value a transfer of $1 at $1, regardless of whether it leads to future income gains or not. \nHowever, if households are credit -constrained today, and the transfer alleviates this credit constraint, one \ncannot make this argument. Instead, if one also counts the value of the future income, the value of the \ntransfer would actually become $1.8 (see Banerjee, Hanna, et al. 2022 for the calculations).  \n \nIn short, this becomes important to note for two reasons. First, in evaluating these programs, $1 given \nmay be worth more than $1 in some sense, if it allows for investment that can have productive flows in \nthe future. This is important as we think about conducting cost -benefit analyses of these programs, as it \nis not just subsidizing households today but potentially increasing futu re incomes. Second, depending on \nthe types of investments a household can make, and the level of credit constraint, it suggests  that getting \nthe size and form of the transfer \u201cright\u201d can help alleviate these constraints if the goal is to help \nhouseholds better invest. Importantly, this idea also forms the basis of many graduation programs, which \nwe discuss in below in Section 2.1.5, that provide large transfers to household s to \u201ccatalyze\u201d the \nhousehold s out of poverty", "article_title": "24", "full_section_title": "", "block_type": "text", "language": "en", "last_edit_date": "2024-01-01", "num_tokens": 337}

Here, we discuss aspects of thes e programs \nrelated to just the cash transfer component; we discuss conditionality below.   \n \nJ-PAL-CID Social Protection Initiative Evidence Review  | povertyactionlab.org  \n 10 BOX 1: SOCIAL ASSISTANCE  AND EARNINGS ABILITY  \nSocial assistance  programs can improve beneficiaries\u2019 earnings ability by, for example, facilitating \nhuman capital investments and reducing credit constraints.  \nConditional cash transfers  (CCTs)  have been associated with improvements in employment -\nrelated outcomes. Gerard, Naritomi, and Silva (2021)  find that Brazil\u2019s Bolsa Familia program has a \npositive impact on formal employment. While the CCT caused a reduction in the formal labor \nsupply of beneficiaries, the expansion of the program led to an overall increase in formal \nemployment, particularly a mong lower -skill occupations, in areas where transfers increased the \nmost. In Mexico, Gertler, Martinez, and Rubio -Codina (2012)  show that poor and rural households \nwho received an additional eighteen  months of Oportunidades transfers increased their \nagricultural incomes by investing part of the transfers into productive assets", "article_title": "24", "full_section_title": "", "block_type": "text", "language": "en", "last_edit_date": "2024-01-01", "num_tokens": 302}
{"id": "24_20", "content_string": ".  \nCCTs have also led to sustained improvements in female earnings.  In Mexico, female cash transfer \nrecipients had a significantly higher labor force participation rate than non -beneficiaries (Parker \nand Vogl 2018) . This led to a long -run increase in labor earnings of approximately 40  percent , on \naverage, for female beneficiaries. In Nicaragua, Barham, Macours, and Maluccio (2018b)  \nassociate higher female earnings with employment gained from temporary migration.  \nLump -sum transfer  programs can also improve earnings ability.  For example,  a long -run study of a \ngraduation program in India found lasting impacts of the program on income (Banerjee et al. \n2016) . \nMaternity leave may be used to improve female labor outcomes. This type of program is relatively \nunderstudied in low - and middle -income countries, but a recent study by Vu and Glewwe (2022)  \nshows that in Vietnam, an increase in duration of mandatory maternity leave shifted potentially \neligible women from informal to formal work, in particular to public sector jobs.  \nFree or subsidi zed childcare has been positively associated with women\u2019s earnings ability. \nCalder\u00f3n (2014)  in Mexico shows that access to childcare reduced the likelihood of women \nearning no income.

Therefore, it is very important in designing the \nprograms to think about what kinds of incentives people will face due to the program and to \nmonitor and measure for impacts.  \n \n   \n \nJ-PAL-CID Social Protection Initiative Evidence Review  | povertyactionlab.org  \n 11 Spillovers . Cash transfers have been shown to have several important types of spillovers on other, non -\nrecipient households, which are important to include when considering the net benefits of these \nprograms. These happen through several different mechanisms.  \n \nInformal insurance:  One type of spillover effect is through informal insurance arrangements in the spirit \nof Townsend (1994) and Ligon, Thomas, and Worrall (2002) . If households are implicitly insuring one \nanother, this could mean that if one household receives a transfer, but another household does not, they \nmay share the proceeds of the transfer to some extent. Angelucci and De Giorgi (2009) , for example, \ndocument these kinds of spillover effects in Mexico\u2019s Progresa program", "article_title": "24", "full_section_title": "", "block_type": "text", "language": "en", "last_edit_date": "2024-01-01", "num_tokens": 275}
{"id": "24_22", "content_string": ". Of course this does not always \ntake place \u2014Evans and Kosec (2020) , by contrast, show that in Tanzania\u2019s CCT, while beneficiary \nhouseholds were more likely to have someone with a personal problem turn to them for assistance, they \nwere no more likely to actually provide assistance to other households.  We discuss interactions with \ninformal insurance more generally below.  \n \nPrices:  A second channel through which cash transfer programs can affect welfare of non -beneficiaries is \nthrough price changes. However, since those receiving benefits tend to spend the benefits on a wide \nvariety of different items, the demand shock for any given item is likely to be small. This, combined with \nthe fact that supply of those items may be at least sometime s elastic, suggests that in practice price \neffects for pure cash transfers may be small. Indeed, several studies, such as Cunha, De Giorgi, and \nJayachandran (2019)  and Egger et al. (2019)  find either zero or economically very small impacts of \ngeneralized cash transfers on prices.5  \n \nOne important counter -example is Filmer et al. (forthcoming)  in the Philippines who studies a cash \ntransfer program in which many, but not all, households in treated areas received benefits \u2014on average \n65 percent of households were treated. As a result of this high saturation, the program raised aggregate \nincomes in  treated villages by about 15 percent. They show  that this led to price increases for protein -\nrich perishable foods (e.g", "article_title": "24", "full_section_title": "", "block_type": "text", "language": "en", "last_edit_date": "2024-01-01", "num_tokens": 330}

They then show that ineligible \nchildren in treated villages demonstrated increased rates of stunting, which they argue is consistent with \ndeclines in protein consumption for non -beneficiaries associated with the higher prices.  \n \nDemand effects:  A third source of spillovers is through Keynesian -type demand multipliers . That is, transfers \nmay be spent locally, boosting incomes of those who provide goods or services to those who received \nthe transfers, who then spend some of their income locally, and so on.  \n \nEgger et al. (2019)  use the fact that the transfer program they study was randomized at the village level to \nestimate a village -level \u201cfiscal multiplier \u201d of this sort. They find that each dollar transferred leads to 2.5 -\n2.8 dollar total increase in local incomes in those villages due to this local multiplier effect. This suggests \nthat these types of demand -side spillovers may be important in local economies, at least in the context of \nthe large, one -time transfers (US D 1,000) that they study", "article_title": "24", "full_section_title": "", "block_type": "text", "language": "en", "last_edit_date": "2024-01-01", "num_tokens": 260}

First, adding conditions adds the costs and complexity \nof imposing, monitoring, and enforcing conditions (which may or may not yield additional gains for \nthese costs). Second, there can be complex ethical issues surrounding which conditions the government  \nwill impose if these conditions are not universally accepted", "article_title": "24", "full_section_title": "", "block_type": "text", "language": "en", "last_edit_date": "2024-01-01", "num_tokens": 262}

Third, having conditions implies that one \nwill remove benefits from those who do not (or cannot) comply, and doing so can have real implications \n \n \n9 Kugler and Rojas (2018)  use a similar strategy but focused more narrowly on the ~500 villages in the early vs. late Progresa impact evaluation sample .  \n \nJ-PAL-CID Social Protection Initiative Evidence Review  | povertyactionlab.org  \n 16 because it means removing assistance from a subset of people who could otherwise benefit from it.  \n \nFor example,  Baird, McIntosh, and \u00d6zler (2011)  study the third issue above, and randomize \ncommunities in Malawi to a UCT, a CCT (based on school attendance), or a control group.

This presents the intriguing \npossibility that a labeled  transfer program  (LCT) could achieve the child impact results that could come \nfrom conditions, without the downsides. There are two types of LCTs: one where households are told \nthat there are conditions, but they are not rigorously enforced ; and another where cash transfers are \naccompanied by nudges, such as messaging that encourag es behavior al change . Such an approach could \nalso save extra monitoring costs. Benhassine et al.

An alternative approach to delivering assistance is to provide households with goods or \nservices directly, rather than cash", "article_title": "24", "full_section_title": "", "block_type": "text", "language": "en", "last_edit_date": "2024-01-01", "num_tokens": 306}
{"id": "24_36", "content_string": ". There are good reasons why cash could be preferred to in -kind \ntransfers \u2014after all, households can choose to use the cash to purchase whatever will increase their utility \nthe most. Moreover, for households that would anyways purchase more of the in -kind good than is \nprovided by the transfer, providing in -kind goods should be th e same as cash, since households can jus t \nreallocate their cash elsewhere.  \n \nHowever, theory provides some reasons why policymakers may prefer in -kind.  First, if the government \ncares explicitly about certain types of outcomes,  such as nutrition or health care, rather than just \nhousehold income or consumption, they may explicitly want to influence the beneficiaries\u2019 consumption \nbasket. When households are constrained \u2014so they are given more of the in -kind good than they would \nconsume otherwise, and cannot easily resell it \u2014in-kind transfers can encourage consumption of these \ntypes of  goods. That would also work if households are constrained in different ways or use mental \naccounting, in which case in -kind transfer s may affect consumption (Hastings and Shapiro 2018) .  \n \nA second reason has to do with how these programs interact with prices. There are two issues. First, in -\nkind transfers often represent a positive supply shock of the good in question (unless the government is \nsourcing it all locally)", "article_title": "24", "full_section_title": "", "block_type": "text", "language": "en", "last_edit_date": "2024-01-01", "num_tokens": 284}

This means that, if s upply is fixed, prices for the subsidized goods may be lower in  \n \nJ-PAL-CID Social Protection Initiative Evidence Review  | povertyactionlab.org  \n 17 an in -kind program than in a cash program (Coate, Johnson, and Zeckhauser 1994; Basu 1996) . Second, \ngovernments typically set in -kind benefits in terms of quantities (i.e., 5 kg of rice per month), whereas \nthey typically set vouchers in terms of prices (i.e., 500 Rupees per month). Setting benefits in terms of \nquantities rather than prices can provide implicit price insurance to beneficiaries (Gadenne et al. 2021; \nHirvonen and Hoddinott 2021) . While in principle the government could adjust the quantity of in -kind \nbenefits based on prices to hold value constant, or conversely adjust the value of vouchers to keep their \nreal value constant, these adjustments may not happen.  \n \nThird, in -kind transfers could potentially improve self -targeting if they increase the cost of participation \nmore for the wealthy (Nichols and Zeckhauser 1982) . For example, if the government provides poor \nquality, subsidized bread, richer households will not bother consuming it.  \n  \nFinally, there are administrative differences between these programs. The infrastructure required to \ndeliver millions of tons of goods is different than the infrastructure required to run a voucher system \nusing electronic debit cards (Banerjee, Hanna, et al", "article_title": "24", "full_section_title": "", "block_type": "text", "language": "en", "last_edit_date": "2024-01-01", "num_tokens": 322}

Several studies examine these issues by \nexperimentally allocating areas into cash, voucher, or in -kind distribution programs. In Mexico, for \nexample, the government ran an RCT that randomized villages into receiving in -kind food transfers, \napproximately eq uivalent cash transfers, or a control group. Several studies have examined this \nexperiment.

First, Leroy et al.

Second, there may be \nimportant spillovers through labor market effects on wages, or they may affect migrati on.  \n \nSeveral studies have examined these issues, largely in the context of MGNREGA. MGNREGA was \nrolled out at the district level in three waves from 2006 -2008, so several papers use this strategy to \nidentify its impact. Imbert and Papp (2015) , for example, use this strategy to examine the impacts of \nMGNREGA on the labor market. Because MGNREGA pays the statutory minimum wage, the \nMGNREGA wage is above the prevailing wage in many cases. One on hand, p erhaps as a result, they \nfind substantial crowd -out of private employment. On the other hand, consistent with MGNREGA \npaying a higher wage, and this having overall equilibrium labor market impacts, Imbert and Papp (2015)  \nfind that private -market dry season wages increase by 4.7 percent.12 As a result, between 22 percent and \n42 percent of the total welfare gains from the program for the three poorest quintiles come from the \naverage market wage effect, rather than direct program effects.

As a \nresult, while the reform raised the income of low -income households by 13 percent, 90 percent of the \ngain came from the equilibrium effects on the private market.

Thinking \nabout this question in the low - and middle -income context is important given that extreme poverty \ntogether with saving s constraints may be more likely to create poverty traps. Specifically, economic \ntheory suggests if people need a discrete amount of money to make an investment \u2014say, to buy a \n \n \n12 Berg et al.

But if they get a single, large, \u201clumpy \u201d \ntransfer, it may be enough to get them over the barrier and purchase the asset. This new asset in turn \ngenerates more income, so they can remain at a new, higher income than before, having escaped the \n\u201cpoverty trap \u201d. To the extent this is true, it suggests a role for lumpy transfers for some types of pe ople \n(for example, entrepreneurs)  rather than streams of payments to spur investments", "article_title": "24", "full_section_title": "", "block_type": "text", "language": "en", "last_edit_date": "2024-01-01", "num_tokens": 326}
{"id": "24_46", "content_string": ".  \n \nOne prediction of these models is that there is a \u201cthreshold \u201d level of capital, so that a transfer beyond \nthis threshold can \u201ctip\u201d households out of the poverty trap and into a higher steady -state level of \nincome. In an RCT in Bangladesh that provided assets to a subset of poor households, Balboni et al. \n(2022)  shows the existence of poverty traps: not only does the transfer temporarily increase incomes in \nthe short run, but for some, it can tip them into a substantially higher steady state.13  \n \nMore generally, a number of studies have examined big -push \u201cgraduation \u201d programs. Big-push program s \nusually consist of a lumpy productive asset \u2014in the form of livestock \u2014bundled with skills training, \nsavings, health education, coaching, and cash payments for a period of time. The goal is to alleviate a \nhousehold\u2019s capital constraints, as well as their sk ills constraints, to \u201cpush\u201d them out of poverty. These \ntypes of programs were pioneered by BRAC in Bangladesh and are now present in over 40 countries and \nmake transfers to over 3 million poor households (Banerjee, Duflo, and Sharma 2021) . Many of these \nprograms explicitly target women or households that include at least one female member. Several studies \nhave found substantial results, including Bandiera et al. (2017)  in Bangladesh; Banerjee et al. (2015)  in \nEthiopia, Ghana, India, Pakistan, and Peru; and Bedoya et al.

In the long run (10 -year follow up), there appears to be no additional growth, but still \npersistent effects for those who received the program (Banerjee, Duflo, and Sharma 2021) . While the \nprograms show substantial long -run effects, they are also expensive. Thus, whether the returns are large \nenough justify the costs depends on the discount rate assumed. In India and Bangladesh, the program \ncosts are low  (i.e., the cost of the asset is not large, program implementation costs are not high) , and the \nimpacts are large, so that the net effect is positive for most plausible discount rates, but this may not be \ntrue in the other countries  (i.e., if larger assets are needed to start a bus iness, or program staff costs are \nhigh) , where the discount rate matters.  \n \nTwo questions that come from these programs are: (1) can the government implement these programs? \nand (2) to make the programs cheaper and more cost effective, can you scale down some components of \nthe program?

But is it the lumpiness per se \nthat matters (as suggested by economic theory), or the other complementary investments that go along \nwith it? To test this, Haushofer and Shapiro (2016; 2018)  experimentally compare the effects of a lump \nsum cash transfer ($404 in PPP terms) to an equivalent cash payment in nine monthly installments. At \nnine months, the monthly transfers increased food security, while lump -sum transfers increased assets. \nThree years after the transfer s, there are no differences between the lumpy and monthly transfer groups. \nIt is important to note that the monthly payments were only spread over nine months and thus may \nunderstate differences when compared to a longer -run transfe r program.

It is important to note that these programs can have categorical eligibility \u2014i.e., \na program can be structured such that every child or every new mother is eligible \u2014or there can be \nincome or other targeting criteria to more narrowly focus assistance on those with fewer resources.  Even \nwithin categorical programs with universal eligibility, one may also want to explore and test mechanisms \nwith which to redistribute to ensure that they are not regressive.

A second common theme is that categorical programs may help reduce stigma \ncompared to poverty -targeted programs (Sen 1995) . For example, if stigma is a real concern, and one \ntargeted school meals to poor children, other children could taunt them and potentially undermine their \nmental health and confidence. If the school meals program is targeted to all children, regardless of  \nincome, it may alleviate the stigma of receiving this kind of help from the government.

These \nprograms have a variety of aims, such as improving current economic conditions, improving educational \noutcomes, improving child mental health and well -being,  and reducing intergenerational poverty.   \n \nChild benefit programs often take the form of cash transfer or in -kind transfer programs (food, clothing, \nwaived school fees) that we discussed earlier in Section 2.1. These programs can have positive effects on \nchildren . For example, there is evidence that CCT programs \u2014one common child benefits program  \nwhich has been extensively studied \u2014lead to an increase in height and a reduction in stunting ( Gertler \n2004 ; Attanasio et al. 2005 ; Kandpal et al. 2016) ; increases in elementary school enrollment  (Schultz \n2004; Todd and Winters 2011; Baird et al. 2014) ; cognitive outcomes for children (Macours, Schady, and \nVakis 2012) ; and reductions in child labor (Barrera -Osorio et al. 2011; Schady and Araujo 2006; \nBenedetti, Ibarrar\u00e1n, and McEwan 2016) .

We have comparatively less research on unconditional cash support programs \naimed at children; this is an important area for future research.  \n   \nThere are also many decisions involved in designing these programs. First, one key design decision is \nhow long children should stay on the program \u2014should the program cover the period when the mother \nis pregnant, the first year or two of life, or should it persist through later years? Emerging evidence \nsuggests that programs that last longer could move different outcome indicators. For example, Cahyadi \net al. (2020)  study the medium -run impact of a CCT program six years after parents were enrolled. They \nshow that large stunting effects at the 6 -year mark, but not at the 2 -year mark. This suggests that if the \ngovernment is targeting outcomes that require cumulative in vestments (e.g., stunting), programs need to \nlast more years. However, more research on how the length of time one is enrolled in a child benefit \nprogram affects outcomes is an important area of future research.   \n \nA second design decision is whether to condition benefit receipt on behaviors that could improve child \noutcomes (e.g., requiring doctor\u2019s appointments, vaccinations, attendance at school)", "article_title": "24", "full_section_title": "", "block_type": "text", "language": "en", "last_edit_date": "2024-01-01", "num_tokens": 298}

Health typically falters as people age, so the elderly are much \nless able to work; this is particularly true for those whose work often entails substantial physical labor. \nSaving (or saving enough) may be difficult , particularly for those outside the formal sector, which include \nmany of the world\u2019s poor. And even for those who do save, ageing entails risk: in particular, the risk that \none will outlive one\u2019s savings. This is particularly relevant to elderly women, wh o on average live longer \nthan men, but are less likely to be covered by contributory pensions (Camilletti 2020) . Traditionally, \nthese challenges were borne by family members (e.g., children caring for parents), but these networks \nmay be incomplete, and may break down with urbanization", "article_title": "24", "full_section_title": "", "block_type": "text", "language": "en", "last_edit_date": "2024-01-01", "num_tokens": 279}

These programs typically have \nthree, related goals: a) to help individuals to save for their old -age, either individually or through a taxes -\nand-transfer scheme, b) to provide annuities that insure against the risk of l iving too long as compare d to \none\u2019s savings, and c) to provide some amount of redistribution so that even those with low incomes are \nnot too poor in their old age.  \n \nAs seen in Figure 3, governments often develop these systems as incomes rise, perhaps coincident with \nthe rise of the more modern economies and increased life expectancies. That said, Figure 3 also reveals \nthat even conditional on real GDP per capita, these programs are becoming more prominent in middle -\nincome and low -income countries.   \n \nJ-PAL-CID Social Protection Initiative Evidence Review  | povertyactionlab.org  \n 25  \nA substantial literature has studied the effects of pension transfers on recipient households, primarily \nfrom the perspective of labor supply and consumption choices.

For example, examining the roll -out of China\u2019s \nNew Rural Pension Scheme, Huang and Zhang (2021)  find that the program increased beneficiary \nincomes, while also reducing mortality. Schemes that can promote greater dignity and autonomy for the \nelderly may reduce depression and improve mental health and decision making of older persons within \nhousehold s (Merttens et al. 2016) .

On the other hand, (Jensen and \nMiller 2017)  suggest that parents may under -invest in education in order to reduce the chan ce that a child \nmigrates away and is unable to provide old -age support. That argument implies that pensions could lead \nto increased education. We regard these interactions as an important area for future study.  \n \nLabor supply effects. A second set of papers tries to understand the impact of pension receipt on labor \nsupply and/or retirement decisions. To the extent that these are income effects (as opposed to price \neffects induced by quirks in the benefit formula), labor supply reduction s associated with pension receipt \nare likely to be welfare -improving, as people appear to have been working longer than they otherwise \nwould have in the absence of a pension.  \n \nSeveral papers find that pensions reduce labor supply. de Carvalho Filho (2008)  studies the reform to the \nBrazilian Social Security System discussed above and shows that these reforms reduced the retirement \nage of rural men. This is an example of a pure income effect, as the transfer was not means - or \nretirement -tested.

There is comparatively less work, however, on program design questions in middle -\nincome countries, but we highlight several papers that suggest some ways in which middle -income \ncontexts may be somewhat different from higher -income contexts.  \n \nOne important question is about contributions: do firms actually report the correct social security \ncontributions, and pay tax accordingly, or do they under -report? Kumler, Verhoogen, and Fr\u00edas (2020)  \nshow that the design of the system may matter: they show that when the pension system switched from \none in which pensions became largely a function of contributions, payments for younger workers (who \nhad more of an incentive to ensure their wages were rep orted accurately) increased.  \n \nA second question is about investment choices. Some contributory systems allow individuals choice in \nhow their assets are invested.

Moreover, for whate ver reason, even at fair prices, insurance demand can be \nquite limited, particularly in low - and middle -income countries, so people may end up with many risks \nuninsured that ex -post can cause them serious challenges.  \n \nThese problems, of course, are not limited to low - and middle -income countries, but they end up in \nmany ways more severe in them, as for many, life in  low- and middle -income countries is particularly \nrisky\u2014for example, 78 percent of poor people reside in rural areas and mostly subsist on agriculture \n(World Bank 2014) , so they face much more income risk than employees", "article_title": "24", "full_section_title": "", "block_type": "text", "language": "en", "last_edit_date": "2024-01-01", "num_tokens": 307}

And there is, on net, much less \ninsurance against these shocks, so households end up taking much more severe actions to smooth \nshocks (see, for example, Chetty and Looney 2007) .  \n \nIn this section, we review the current state of knowledge on social insurance schemes designed to \naddress two key kinds of shocks in low - and middle -income countries. In Section 3.1, we examine those \nthat insur e against income  shocks, e.g., unemployment insurance  and insurance against agriculture loss . In \nSection 3.2, we discuss those that help cushion expenditure  shocks, e.g., health insurance and property \ninsurance , as they may require different types of programs.   We then discuss interactions with existing \ninformal insuranc e in Section 3.3 . \n \nNote that the focus in this section is on programs that are explicitly designed to address risks. But risk \ninteracts with social protection systems in other ways. For example, social assistance  programs, by \nproviding support to those who fall into poverty  because they are hit with a shock , also help with risk. \nWe explore the inter -relationships across these types of programs, and how they can work together in an \nintegrated social protection system, in Section 5 below.  \n \n3.1: INSURANCE AGAINST INCOME LOSS  \nThis section covers risks of income loss; Section 3.2 below covers expenditure risks", "article_title": "24", "full_section_title": "", "block_type": "text", "language": "en", "last_edit_date": "2024-01-01", "num_tokens": 303}

Before we discuss \nvarious programs (both on income loss but also expenditure loss), it is worth noting that we are \nreviewing the available evidence on the typical programs that countries implement, and not advocating \none particular policy or program over another. For example, some programs may be more appropriate to \nmiddle -income countries than low -income countries given context and institutions; others may be more \nmay be more appropriate to those with large agricultural sectors than those with large and g rowing urban \nsectors.  \n  \n \nJ-PAL-CID Social Protection Initiative Evidence Review  | povertyactionlab.org  \n 34 3.1.1: Insurance against Involuntary Job Loss \nUnemployment insurance (UI) is designed to help people smooth consumption between jobs. However, \na key challenge is that unemployment benefits typically continue until the worker resumes work. There is \nan extensive literature on the degree to which this co nditioning of benefits on future employment \ndiscourages job search in high -income countries , focusing on (1) the tradeoffs between the welfare gains \nfrom the insurance component of these programs against these potential disincentive effects, and \nwhether th e different policy design choices made within these programs (i.e. , the level and duration of \nbenefits) can improve welfare, and (2) whether the benefits allow for better job matching (e.g", "article_title": "24", "full_section_title": "", "block_type": "text", "language": "en", "last_edit_date": "2024-01-01", "num_tokens": 288}

This \nhas two important implications. First, the government cann ot provide benefits that start conditional on \nunemployment for those in the informal sector, and so informal workers may not actually be covered by \nUI. Second, the government also has challenges conditioning benefits on re -employment (since it only \nobserve s formal employment), and thus workers receiving UI could choose to seek employment in the \ninformal sector in order to continue receiving their benefits. There is therefore also a worry that these \nkinds of programs may also disincentivize formalization, wh ich has consequences for productivity, \ntaxation, workplace safety, and so on.  \n \nGerard and Gonzaga (2021)  examine the relationship between informality and unemployment insurance \nin Brazil", "article_title": "24", "full_section_title": "", "block_type": "text", "language": "en", "last_edit_date": "2024-01-01", "num_tokens": 292}

They find, perhaps counterintuitively, that the presence of a large informal sector reduces  the \nefficiency consequences of moral hazard in UI, and indeed, they estimate that the efficiency costs of UI \nare 5 times lower in Brazil than in the United States. This is because the presence of the informal sector \nallows workers to keep working (albeit informally) while retaining UI benefits, so while workers do lose \nformal protecti ons from getting an informal job, this reduces the overall efficiency consequences of the \nUI tax on re -employment. Of course, this comes at a cost, because informal jobs have lower earnings \nthan formal jobs, a finding echoed in Liepmann and Pignatti (2021) \u2019s study in Mauritius.  These papers \nsuggest that further understanding optimal UI design in the presence of a large informal sector is \nimportant for future research.  \n \nAlternatives to Unemployment Insurance  \nGiven these challenges, one often observes alternative policies to UI to help to insure workers against \njob loss. A common policy is mandated  severance pay ; that is, a lump -sum payment upon termination \nof a labor relationship, when termination is initiated by the firm. This payment is not conditioned on \nfuture employment, and thus does not distort future employment decisions.  \n \nSeverance programs are not without challenges. First, someone needs to adjudicate that the worker was, \nindeed, working, and was terminated", "article_title": "24", "full_section_title": "", "block_type": "text", "language": "en", "last_edit_date": "2024-01-01", "num_tokens": 298}

If firms are supposed to pay directly, the government needs to \n \n \n18 A number of recent papers also examine the spillover effects of unemployment insurance on domestic violence ( Bhalotra et al. 2021)  and crime \n(Britto, Pinotti, and Sampaio forthcoming) .   \n \nJ-PAL-CID Social Protection Initiative Evidence Review  | povertyactionlab.org  \n 35 ensure that they do; if the government collects taxes and pays severance, it needs to collect the taxes to \ndo so. Weak institutions may exacerbate the enforcement challenges. For example, Sadka, Seira, and \nWoodruff (2018)  examine this in the context of Mexico, where despite a strong severance policy on the \nbooks, many workers do not receive their full entitlement, and delays and misinformation abound in the \ncourt system. They show  that improving institutional quality could help: providing information about \nlikely court outcomes substantially shortens settlement times, improving the food security of workers.  \n \nSeverance payments have other challenges: the need to pay large severance payments in the event of a \ntermination may serve as a disincentive for firms to hire in the first place, and a single lump -sum means \nthat the worker bears the risk of being unemploye d longer than average. Moreover, studying data from \nS\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil, Gerard, Naritomi, and Silva (2021)  show that workers appear to over -spend from the \nlump -sum severance payment relative to their optimal consumption profile", "article_title": "24", "full_section_title": "", "block_type": "text", "language": "en", "last_edit_date": "2024-01-01", "num_tokens": 324}

They suggest that a stream \nof payments (which could, of course, also be unconditional) may provide better consumption smoothing \nthan a lump -sum; research on these policies could be an important future direction.  \n \nA different alternative ( first proposed, to our knowledge, by Feldstein and Altman 1998)  is to create \nunemployment savings accounts , where workers have an individual account that they can access in \ncase of job loss. The accounts can be funded through mandatory contributions by workers and/or firms. \nThe idea is that individual accounts help align incentives and reduce the scope for mor al hazard. \nHowever, they do not have the risk pooling features of traditional insurance, although, in cases where \nthe individual account does not have any money, or has too little, the government could supplement the \nfunds, guaranteeing a minimum. Countries such as Colombia, Chile, Indonesia, and Mexico have \nimplemented forms of this type of system. Kugler (2005)  and Nagler (2013)  examine the impacts of the \nshift from severance to these types of linked accounts in Colombia and Chile, respectively, on wages and \njob duration.  \n \nIn short, the challenges of the large informal sector mean that the design of insurance programs for \nunemployment in low - and middle -income countries may need to be fundamentally different than those \nin high -income ones", "article_title": "24", "full_section_title": "", "block_type": "text", "language": "en", "last_edit_date": "2024-01-01", "num_tokens": 287}

It also suggests avenues for future  research, particularly on policies that are not \nconditioned on re -employment (e.g., time -limited benefits, individual unemployment -triggered savings \naccounts, severance, lump -sum unemployment insurance paid by the government). Moreover, given the \ninformat ion constraints, countries are also designing self -targeting techniques that condition benefits on \ncostly (but potentially productive) activities \u2014e.g., Indonesia requires job training to receive benefits, \nmany countries are designing public works programs.  Understanding their impacts on both insurance, \nand ultimately labor market activities, is important.  \n  \n3.1.2: Insurance against Disability and Death  \nDisability insurance  is designed to help insure workers against accidents or illnesses that may either \ntemporarily or permanently remove them from the labor market. However, similar to UI, the large \ninformal sector hinders governments from providing universal disability cover age or workplace accident \ninsurance through employers.  \n \nTherefore, one often observes alternative policies to provide financial assistance to people with disability . \nThis is important because of the additional costs associated with living with a disability (for example, on  \n \nJ-PAL-CID Social Protection Initiative Evidence Review  | povertyactionlab.org  \n 36 health and transportation)", "article_title": "24", "full_section_title": "", "block_type": "text", "language": "en", "last_edit_date": "2024-01-01", "num_tokens": 259}

Covering disability only through general anti -poverty programs, \nhowever, has two challenges: (1) this only provides insurance for those near the threshold of poverty \n(and not the middle class) and (2) if targeting is done infrequently, the sign -up period may not align with \nwhen people need assista nce.  \n \nAnother option, instead, is to provide programs that directly provide assistance to people with disability . \nWe suggest that providing more evidence on the design and effectiveness of these programs is an \nimportant area for additional research.  \n \nA related issue is workplace accident insurance . This is often separate from disability insurance, in \npart because of an attempt to link the risks back to the employers. While some middle -income countries \nare trying to provide this type of insurance at least to those workers in the formal sector, this remains an \narea that is comparatively underexplored in the economics literature", "article_title": "24", "full_section_title": "", "block_type": "text", "language": "en", "last_edit_date": "2024-01-01", "num_tokens": 272}

The death of a primary income earner is a substantial income \nloss, and indeed, throughout many countries, widowhood is often closely associated with poverty. \nFormal life insurance markets tend to be much smaller (as a share of GDP) in low - and middle -income \ncountries compared to high -income countries, suggesting that indeed much more of this risk remains \nuninsured (\u201cLife Insurance Volume - Country Rankings\u201d 2019) . Moreover, the relative paucity of formal \npensions \u2014which in high -income countries, often come with survivors\u2019 benefits that help insure spouses \nagainst the income loss of their primary earner \u2014further leaves more of this risk uninsured. As with \ndisability,  widow status is often considered in proxy -means test  (PMT ) formulas, but similarly, this only \nprovides insurance to the extent that households are near the poverty threshold. Understanding how to \nbetter insure the spouses and children of the deceased is a n important area for additional research.  \n  \n3.1", "article_title": "24", "full_section_title": "", "block_type": "text", "language": "en", "last_edit_date": "2024-01-01", "num_tokens": 275}

And agriculture is risky: crops can fail, and prices are volatile, so those \nengaged in agriculture as their primary occupation face much more income risk than those who work in \nmanufacturing or other sectors, and these risks are not covered by traditiona l unemployment insurance \nschemes.

Nearly 190 \ncountries have some sort of public health insurance system.20 \n \nThe literature on health insurance tends to fall into two common buckets. The first bucket examines the \nimpact of health insurance on households who have this insurance, including the ability to smooth out \nthe economic consequences that may arise from heal th shocks as well as impacts on health utilization \nand, potentially, health", "article_title": "24", "full_section_title": "", "block_type": "text", "language": "en", "last_edit_date": "2024-01-01", "num_tokens": 306}

The second bucket then explores the challenges in provision and design of \ninsurance, particularly around how to design and fund public insurance systems given the constraints \ncomi ng from informal employment, adverse selection, moral hazard, information failures, and trust.  \n \nImpacts of Health Insurance  \nWe start with the first bucket, reviewing the studies that aim to measure health insurance impacts. Before \nbeginning, it is worth noting, conceptually, that the primary outcome one would expect health insurance \nto affect is consumption smoothing. That is, health insurance is primarily a financial product, that \nprovides payments in the event of an expenditure shock, and so should make the financial consequences \nof bad health less severe (Finkelstein and McKnight 2008) . Health insurance can also affect health care \nconsumption; since health insurance typically reduces the marginal cost of health care utilization (as \nopposed to, say, giving people a lump -sum cash transfer when they are diagnosed with illness, which \nwould help with the financial consequences without changing prices on the margin), one would expect \nutilization to increase. This increased health care utilization could, in turn, potentially affect health, but \nonly if the resulting care has a measurable effect on health.  \n \nHealth insurance and financial shocks", "article_title": "24", "full_section_title": "", "block_type": "text", "language": "en", "last_edit_date": "2024-01-01", "num_tokens": 259}

There is also suggestive evidence that health insurance may also reduce financial stress \nabove and beyond its impact on finances per se ( Haushofer et al. 2020) . \n \nHealth care utilization and health.  Health insurance also has the potential to change health care utilization, \nsince it typically reduces the price of health care, which could in turn generate health impacts", "article_title": "24", "full_section_title": "", "block_type": "text", "language": "en", "last_edit_date": "2024-01-01", "num_tokens": 305}
{"id": "24_90", "content_string": ". In some \ncontexts, one may actually be concerned that this leads to over consumption of health care since \nconsumers do not face the true marginal cost of the care, and indeed, in some high -income countries, \nalternative health insurance schemes with high deductibles have been developed in an attempt to provide \nfinancial insurance while ensuring that households face the correct price of care on the margin. On the \nflip side, if households are liquidity constrained (as we believe m any low -income households are), \nhouseholds may under -consume health care without insurance. Understanding how to help households \nachieve their optimal, distortion -free level of health consumption remains an important challenge.  \n \nDoes health insurance change health consumption, and health, in low - and middle -income countries? \nThe experimental evidence on the impact of health care utilization and health is mixed, though one big \nchallenge may be that some of the experimental studies on this may not be sufficiently powered to detect \neconomically meaningful, but small effects ( King et al. 2009 ; Haushofer et al. 2020) . A recent study by \nMalani et al. (2021)  highlighted another important policy issue: in their experiment, while they find some \nincreases in households using insurance for payment, they found that many of the beneficiaries had \nchallenges in using their insurance \u2014e.g", "article_title": "24", "full_section_title": "", "block_type": "text", "language": "en", "last_edit_date": "2024-01-01", "num_tokens": 283}

In short, most of \nthe experimental studies to date find little overall impact of health insurance on health outc omes.  \n \nGiven the need for large samples sizes to measure impact, a number of other studies focus on quasi -\nexperimental variation from large -scale public health insurance reforms, and then use large administrative \ndatasets on mortality and national samples.21 For example, Gruber, Lin, and Yi (2021)  examines the roll -\nout of China\u2019s public health insurance for rural households, which covered as many as 800 million \npeople. They find a significant decline in aggregate mortality, which they argue could explain 78 percent \nof the entire increase in life expectancy in China during t his period. Using survey data, they find large \neffects on health care utilization and a host of other health outcomes.  \n \nGruber, Hendren, and Townsend (2014) study an alternative method of health insurance: the expansion \nof free or heavily subsidized care at public facilities. They examine Thailand\u2019s 2001 health care reform, \nknown as the \u201c30 Baht\u201d program. Prior to this refo rm, the poor, young , and old were given free public \nhealth care, but the system was seen as chronically underfunded. The reform changed the system in two \nways. First, it provided universal access to public facilities at a co -pay of 30 Baht (or $0", "article_title": "24", "full_section_title": "", "block_type": "text", "language": "en", "last_edit_date": "2024-01-01", "num_tokens": 322}

Second, the reform provided hospitals with a universal \n \n \n21 See Gruber, Lin, and Yi (2021) , who provide a nice overview of the literature .  \n \nJ-PAL-CID Social Protection Initiative Evidence Review  | povertyactionlab.org  \n 39 capitation payment based on population in the province; this on net moved to more generous \ngovernment financing. Using administrative morality records, they show that prior to the reform, the \ninfant mortality rate was related to how rich the province was; after the reform, resources were equalized \nacross provinces leading to this correlation disappearing.  \n \nImportantly, both Gruber, Lin, and Yi (2021)  and Gruber, Hendren, and Townsend (2014)  argue that \npart of why large health effects were seen is that the insurance reforms, by increasing financing by the \ngovernment for health, increased the supply of health services, as has been shown in high-income  \ncountries (e.g., Finkelstein 2007) . This suggests that in evaluating health insurance systems \nexperimentally, it may be important to randomize across a hospital catchment area or health market, \nrather than an individual level or village, in order to estimate the full general equilibrium im pacts that \ncould arise due to an insurance expansion or enhancement", "article_title": "24", "full_section_title": "", "block_type": "text", "language": "en", "last_edit_date": "2024-01-01", "num_tokens": 311}

For example, many countries choose not to universally cover health insurance premiums \nthrough the government budget, and instead set up national h ealth insurance programs where the poor \nare covered directly and everyone else has to pay a mandatory contribution. Contributions are often \ncollected for formal workers through payroll taxes remitted by employers.  \n \nA common challenge with these systems, however, is what to do about informal workers (for whom \npremia cannot be collected from employers). There are, broadly speaking, three options. First, there is \nthe option of no health insurance for non -poor, informal workers. This, of course, would mean that \nthese workers remain vulnerable to the economic impacts of a health emergency. Moreover, if firms \nwant to evade paying benefits to formal workers and/or workers do not fully value the insurance,  \nmandating insurance  benefits for formal workers could increase informality.  \n \nA second policy option \u2014which is quite common \u2014is to mandate that non -poor, informal workers \ncontribute to insurance. This is difficult to enforce, however, particularly in countries with limited \nadministrative capacity, and many people do not comply", "article_title": "24", "full_section_title": "", "block_type": "text", "language": "en", "last_edit_date": "2024-01-01", "num_tokens": 264}
{"id": "24_94", "content_string": ". With i mperfect compliance, in addition to \nworries about increases in informality described above, this can also lead to adverse selection problems \n(i.e., only signing up when sick) that can financially strain the insurance system.   \n \nFinally, the third option is to decide that it is too difficult to collect contributions from informal workers, \nand extend free insurance to most, if not all, informal workers. Once again, concerns about encouraging \ninformality arise in this case, as well as concerns about the cost.  \n \nBelow, we first discuss the evidence on the interplay between health insurance and informality. We then \ndiscuss the evidence on the adverse selection, as well as some of the policy tools that have been used to \ntry to mitigate it.  \n \nHealth Insurance and Informality  \nEx-ante, the effect of employer provided (or subsidized) health insurance is ambiguous. If a) workers \nvalue the insurance and b) there is a cost -savings (from the workers\u2019 perspective) of gaining it by \nbecoming a formal employee as opposed to paying an ind ividual premium, this could increase  \n \nJ-PAL-CID Social Protection Initiative Evidence Review  | povertyactionlab.org  \n 40 formalization. But, if workers do not value the insurance at cost or if alternative health care \narrangements are cheaper, it could increase informality.  \n \nA number of papers examine these concepts", "article_title": "24", "full_section_title": "", "block_type": "text", "language": "en", "last_edit_date": "2024-01-01", "num_tokens": 293}
{"id": "24_95", "content_string": ".  \n \nA number of papers examine these concepts. For example, Bergolo and Cruces (2014)  examine a large -\nscale policy reform in Uruguay\u2019s social insurance administration (SIA) that both increased benefits and \ncontributions for formal workers, and find evidence of both effects. The reform extended the SIA\u2019s \ncoverage for dependent children, mak ing the program more attractive. At the same time, the reform also \nincreased the payroll tax contribution deducted from employees' salaried earnings, which could cause an \nincrease in underreporting of wages for formal employees. The authors find both effec ts: the greater \nbenefits drew people into the system, but there was also an increase in misreporting wages. On net, the \nfiscal revenue gain from higher levels of formal employees was much larger than the loss of revenue due \nto under reporting.  \n \nCamacho, Conover, and Hoyos (2014)  examine the introduction of subsidized insurance for informal \nworkers on labor market choices in Colombia. A reform was instituted that made workers who were \nbelow a Poverty Index Score eligible for non -contributory health insurance, but those who were fo rmally \nemployed were ineligible regardless of their score (and needed to contribute through their employers) \u2014\ncreating an incentive to become informal. They find the reform increased informal employment by about \n3-4 percentage points.  \n \nFinally, a number of papers have examined Mexico\u2019s Seguro Popular on formalization", "article_title": "24", "full_section_title": "", "block_type": "text", "language": "en", "last_edit_date": "2024-01-01", "num_tokens": 304}

For idiosyncratic perils, private insurance markets should work well in \nprinciple. However, in low - and middle -income contexts, where information is worse, adverse selection \nand moral hazard may be a challenge.

Funeral insurance can help manage these risks, whether \nthrough community associations or burial clubs (Dercon et al. 2006; Case et al. 2013; Berg 2018 ), \nreligious institutions ( Auriol et al. 2020) , or private insurance companies (Berg 2018)", "article_title": "24", "full_section_title": "", "block_type": "text", "language": "en", "last_edit_date": "2024-01-01", "num_tokens": 318}

Indeed, villagers are better at smoothing \nidiosyncratic consumption shocks than one may have expected given the absent formal insurance \nmarkets (Townsend 1994) . But, from the perspective of a potential social insurance designer, it is \nimportant to note that just because informal insurance exists does not mean that there is not a need for \nformal insurance schemes", "article_title": "24", "full_section_title": "", "block_type": "text", "language": "en", "last_edit_date": "2024-01-01", "num_tokens": 310}

Moreover, a potential downside of informal insurance systems is that they can \u201ctrap\u201d \npeople in areas where they may have fewer opportunities. For example, there may be inefficiencies if \nhouseholds need to remain in rural areas in order to take  advantage of these informal networks (Banerjee \nand Newman 1998) .  \n \nEven when informal insurance exists, it does not necessarily provide the level of coverage that \nhouseholds need, since income shocks have a strong spatial correlation, especially in agricultural areas. \nIdeally, risk -pooling would be done across villages wh ere shocks are independent, but these \narrangements are difficult in practice since monitoring costs to prevent moral hazard are too high.24 \nThese spatially correlated shocks may be a particular challenge with natural disasters or conflict, \nnecessitating large scope disaster relief programs", "article_title": "24", "full_section_title": "", "block_type": "text", "language": "en", "last_edit_date": "2024-01-01", "num_tokens": 277}

Its main attraction is its simplicity in selecting \nregions and the administrative ease of implementing it \u2014since one does not need individual data, one can \nactually do the entire exercise (prediction and targeting) with a si ngle, representative dataset (Baker and \nGrosh 1994; Elbers et al. 2007)", "article_title": "24", "full_section_title": "", "block_type": "text", "language": "en", "last_edit_date": "2024-01-01", "num_tokens": 286}

To improve prediction, one can combine survey sample data with \ncensus data to predict the poverty status of smaller geographical areas (Elbers, Lanjouw, and Lanjouw \n2003) , or use newer remote -sensed satellite or administration datasets that help predict smaller regions \n(e.g. Jean et al. 2016; Blumenstock, Cadamuro, and On 2015) . The literature thus far suggests that this \napproach produces less accurate estimates than individual poverty targeting, but it is much less data \nintensive, which may have some appeal when the environment for collecting data is weaker  or in areas \nwhere individual targeting may be political infeasible .  \n \nTargeting Using Proxy -Means Tests.  \nA second form of poverty targeting is the proxy -means test  (PMT). The implementation of a PMT is \nbased on two datasets. First, a training dataset that includes measures of what the government is actually \ntrying to target (e.g., per -capita household consumption, income, etc.), as well as the characteristics \n(\ud835\udc4b\u2032)\u2014usually demographics and assets \u2014that will be used for targeting. This training dataset is usually a \nnationally representative household survey that is collected for research or general statistical purposes; as  \nsuch, households typically have no reason to lie about their actual consumption or income. Using these \ndata, one then estimates a model that relates income to each of the targeted characteristics (of the form \n\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc56=\ud835\udc4b\u2032\ud835\udefd+\ud835\udf16\ud835\udc56 )", "article_title": "24", "full_section_title": "", "block_type": "text", "language": "en", "last_edit_date": "2024-01-01", "num_tokens": 333}

This is the step where there is often some self -selection \u2014for \nexample, in some cases, the government will collect the characteristics \ud835\udc4b\ud835\udc56 only for those who apply, and \nhence only applicants may be deemed eligible; in other cases, the government attempts to collect the \ud835\udc4b\ud835\udc56 \nfor almost everyone by having census enumerators go door -to-door throughout the country. Using this  \n \nJ-PAL-CID Social Protection Initiative Evidence Review  | povertyactionlab.org  \n 48 much larger dataset, one calculates a predicted poverty score, \ud835\udc66\ud835\udc56\u0302, using the characteristics \ud835\udc4b\ud835\udc56 and the \nestimates of \ud835\udefd\u0302, for each individual \ud835\udc56 that is then used for poverty targeting.  \n \nThis type of proxy -means testing was first used in the early 1980s in Chile for the targeting of its Ficha \nCAS program, and has become quite common ( Coady, Grosh, and Hoddinott 2004) . Examples of \nproxy -means tests include the SISBEN in Colombia, SISFOH in Peru, Listahanan  in the Philippines, \nBISP in Pakistan, and Takaful and Karama in Egypt.  \n \nThe way that proxy -means tests are implemented comes with some policy challenges.

The \nmodel used to predict PMT scores also makes no allowance for differences in preferences in \nconsumption. Someone might end up in a bigger house than what would  normally correspond with their \nincome because, for example, they feel obligated to provide temporary housing to their extended family. \nThese differences in preferences drive noise in the link between true income and PMT -predicted \nincomes, which  is a major  challenge in targeting algorithms.  \n \nRecent advances have sought to reduce noise in PMTs in two ways , with varying levels of success . First, \none can replace the OLS prediction equation with more sophisticated machine -learning prediction \nalgorithms. However, most papers find little to no improvements using these techniques relative to the \ncommon methods currently used (e.g. , McBride and Nichols 2018 ; Baez, Kshirsagar, and Skoufias 2020 ; \nAreias and Wai -Poi 2022 ).  \n \nSecond, one can use new types of administrative data rather than collecting a door -to-door census, which \nallows more frequent, and hence up -to-date, data to be used. For example, Blumenstock, Cadamuro, and \nOn (2015)  use anonymized data from mobile phone networks to predict the socioeconomic status of \nindividual subscribers; similarly Abelson, Varshney, and Sun (2014)  use remote sensing to differentiate \nbetween thatched and metal roofs in Kenya\u2019s GiveDirectly program", "article_title": "24", "full_section_title": "", "block_type": "text", "language": "en", "last_edit_date": "2024-01-01", "num_tokens": 332}

Using data from Togo, Aiken et al. \n(2022)  find that using mobile phone metadata for targeting has substantive predictive power, though it is \nnot as accurate as a more traditional full PMT. The fact that administrative data such as this is \ncontinually and automatically updated suggests that target ing using these types of data may be more \nresponsive to shocks, and may help policymakers more easily move people on and off beneficiary lists \ndepending on people\u2019s current needs.25 In fact, some countries, from Pakistan to Togo, used this \napproach to target assistance during the 2020 C ovid-19 crisis (Gentilini et al. 2020) . Understanding \nwhether these kinds of administrative data are effective in capturing more timely measures of economic \nneed is an important area of ongoing and future work.  \n \nDoes PMT cause people to change their consumption?  \nA further challenge is that many characteristics used in this type of targeting are, themselves, choice \nvariables, and this introduces an additional potential source of inefficiency, since households need to \ndistort their consumption to remain eligible. Fo r example, after England imposed a \u201cwindow tax\u201d in \n1696 \u2014a tax levied on the number of windows a house had, which proxied for wealth \u2014people built new \nhouses with very few windows, leading to many dark houses (Oates and Schwab 2015) . This may have \nreal implications, especially if households do not invest in productive assets (e.g", "article_title": "24", "full_section_title": "", "block_type": "text", "language": "en", "last_edit_date": "2024-01-01", "num_tokens": 312}

But, in practice, are these distortions \nsubstantial in modern contexts?  \n \nTo investigate these issues with individual -level targeting in a modern proxy -means test, Banerjee et al. \n(2020)  conducted a nationwide randomized experiment, in cooperation with the Indonesian \n \n \n25 Others (e.g. Baez, Kshirsagar, and Skoufias 2020; del Ninno and Mills 2015 ) suggest augmenting PMT targeting system with remote sensed and/or \nadministrative data of this sort to help capture shocks.   \n \nJ-PAL-CID Social Protection Initiative Evidence Review  | povertyactionlab.org  \n 50 Government\u2019s Central Bureau of Statistics, which administers the census used for actual PMT targeting. \nTo test for these types of distortions, the statistics bureau randomly added questions on flat -screen \ntelevisions and/or the number of cell phone SIM car ds owned to the targeting census in some randomly \nselected provinces, but not in others. While self -reports of television ownership fell in treated provinces \nsix months later, that effect quickly died out, and more importantly, there were no changes in act ual \ntelevision purchases or active SIM cards in treated areas", "article_title": "24", "full_section_title": "", "block_type": "text", "language": "en", "last_edit_date": "2024-01-01", "num_tokens": 303}
{"id": "24_118", "content_string": ".  \n \nOne potential reason why real -world distortions from proxy -means tests are small is that that there are \nmany different variables, interacting in complex ways in the PMT formula, which means that households \nhave limited control over the outcome and therefor e the returns to manipulation are small. In fact, \ngovernments typically keep the formulas secret for this reason: studying the proxy -means test in \nColombia, Camacho and Conover (2011)  find that local politicians were only able to manipulate the data \nafter the formula became public in order sign up more of their constituents for federal government \ntransfers.26 Of course, doing so comes at a cost of reduced transparency; exploring the tradeoffs involved \nin transparency around these formulas is an interesting open question.  \n \nFinally, in contrast to PMTs, there is some evidence that geographic targeting can lead to real distortions \nthat may affect people\u2019s livelihoods. In particular, place -based policies \u2014which in contrast to PMTs are \neasy to understand \u2014can induce migration to a reas with generous transfer programs and/or prevent out -\nmigration from these areas. For example, Imbert and Papp (2020)  show that India\u2019s public works \nprogram, the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act ( MGNREGA )\u2014which was \ngeographically targeted to rural areas \u2014reduced seasonal migration to urban areas", "article_title": "24", "full_section_title": "", "block_type": "text", "language": "en", "last_edit_date": "2024-01-01", "num_tokens": 291}

Given that geographic \nprograms are very common, it would be important for future research to understand if this happens in \nother types of programs and contexts, a nd if there are ways to mitigate it. For example, is it possible to \nuse newer digital technologies to let people keep their benefits even if they en gage in seasonal migration?  \n \n4.1.2: Self -Selection Mechanisms  \nAnother approach to identifying beneficiaries is a self-selection mechanism . The idea is to pair \nbenefits with an action, where the required action is relatively less costly for the targeted population than \nfor the rest (Nichols and Zeckhauser 1982) . If so, the selection rule allows the government to make an \ninference about people\u2019s income (though perhaps not always perfectly) from their self -chosen actions. \nThe required action can include buying low -quality food, work requirements, and administrativ e ordeals \n(e.g., standing in line, filling out lengthy paperwork, or having to go through an interview process). The \ndisadvantage of this approach is that it imposes costs on the poor \u2014i.e., lower quality food than they \nwould prefer, or time wasted standing  in pointless lines. The key question is whether the benefits of this \nmethod, which might allow governments to deliver more aid to the poor, outweigh these additional \ncosts, so that both the poor individuals themselves and society are nevertheless better o ff even once \nthese costs are taken into consideration.  \n \nPublic Works Programs", "article_title": "24", "full_section_title": "", "block_type": "text", "language": "en", "last_edit_date": "2024-01-01", "num_tokens": 311}

One of the most common self -selection mechanisms are public works programs \u2014\ni.e., requiring beneficiaries to work in exchange for payments. These programs have a long history, dating \n \n \n26 Though there is limited evidence so far of actual manipulation of consumption, one could imagine cases in which it may be. If  so, recent theoretical \nadvances suggest that it is possible to improve poverty targeting by anticipating these problems and takin g them into account (Bj\u00f6rkegren, Blumenstock, \nand Knight 2020; Ball 2022) .   \n \nJ-PAL-CID Social Protection Initiative Evidence Review  | povertyactionlab.org  \n 51 back at least to the 19th century in England, where transfers were granted through residence in a \nworkhouse (Besley and Coate 1992 ), and to the United States\u2019 Civilian Conservation Corps and Works \nProgress Administration in the 1930s (Aizer et al. 2020) .  \n \nThey are a classic example of what is referred to in the economics literature as an \u201cordeal mechanism\u201d \n(i.e., a required action meant to separate rich and poor) because work takes time. If the wages for the \npublic works job are low, or the tasks unpleasant  or difficult, this will generate self -selection: those who \ncan get a more attractive job will select out (Ravallion 1991; Besley and Coate 1992) . But, if the wage is \nset too high, the program runs the risk of crowding out more productive private sector work", "article_title": "24", "full_section_title": "", "block_type": "text", "language": "en", "last_edit_date": "2024-01-01", "num_tokens": 332}

Using public works \nto build roads may have little efficiency loss; having workfare labor dig ditches no one needs would also \ngenerate self -selection, but at much larger social efficiency costs.  \n \nPerhaps the largest such program in the world is India\u2019s Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment \nGuarantee Act (also known as MGNREGA), which offers 100 days of paid employment per year to \nanyone in rural areas who is willing to do casual manual labor. MG NREGA\u2019s wage rate is tied to the \nofficial state minimum wage, which may be above the de facto wage available to rural agricultural \nlaborers, given the large informal economy. Nevertheless, Dutta et al. (2014)  find substantial self -\nselection in program take -up.  \n \nGiven that public works programs, by their nature, crowd out other work, estimating the efficiency costs \nare challenging.  \n\u2022 Murgai, Ravallion, and van de Walle (2016)  investigate this in the Indian state of Bihar by asking \nworkfare participants their best estimate of what their earnings would have been in the absence \nof a public works program. They find that those who joined MGNREGA gave up income \nequivalent to about 3 0-35 percent of the workfare income received. They suggest that a simple \ncash transfer would result in modestly higher poverty reductions than the MGNREGA, given \nboth the government\u2019s costs to run the program and these forgone wages", "article_title": "24", "full_section_title": "", "block_type": "text", "language": "en", "last_edit_date": "2024-01-01", "num_tokens": 330}

They find that while the program led to earnings gains, \nearning gains are only 53 percent of the transfer due to the crowd -out of private emplo yment.  \n \nNote that both of these programs set the public works wage at the formal minimum wage, which \u2014\nunlike in many high -income country settings \u2014may be above the prevailing market wage, given the large \ninformal sector.

Upon application, programs often add additional screening mechanisms, such as a PMT.27 This \ncan affect selection in two ways", "article_title": "24", "full_section_title": "", "block_type": "text", "language": "en", "last_edit_date": "2024-01-01", "num_tokens": 292}

First, to the extent that prospective beneficiaries understand the \nscreening mechanism, those who know they will not be eligible may choose not to apply. This saves the \ngovernment the cost of verifying these applican ts. Second, beneficiaries will use their own estimate of \ntheir likelihood of passing the screening when deciding whether to apply. This estimate will be a mix of \nthe information used in the screening mechanisms, plus their private information about their true income \nlevel. Thus, if people have imperfect information or beliefs about the screening mechanism, asking them \nto decide to apply may induce them to reveal some of this private information to the government.  \n \nAlatas et al. (2016)  develop a model that captures this idea, and then experimentally test a self -targeting \nmechanism (application with verification done by PMT) against automatic enrollment based on a PMT \ndone by census enumerators within the context of the expansion of the government\u2019s conditional cash \ntransfer program.

Surprisingly, this approach also reduces exclusion error compared to the PMT \u2014while the \ngovernment makes it s best efforts to include all relevant people in the automatic enrollment system, \nsome of the very poor, who live more on the margins of society, can be missed; in the self -targeting \ngroup, these individuals apply", "article_title": "24", "full_section_title": "", "block_type": "text", "language": "en", "last_edit_date": "2024-01-01", "num_tokens": 298}

This suggests that self -selection at the application stage can allow for the \nrevelation of important information, potentially decreasing both inclusion and exclusion error over \nautomatic enrollment approaches.  \n \nSelf-declaration with unverified means tests . A third type of self -selection involves self -declared means tests. \nFor example, in Brazil\u2019s Bolsa Familia program, eligibility is based on self -reported income. For most \nworkers in the informal sector, this cannot be directly verified \u2014but nevertheless, this procedure may \nresult in those who are not poor choosing not to enroll in the program. Understanding the degree to \nwhich these self -declared processes do or not serve as an effective self -targeting system is a n important \nopen question.  \n \nMore generally, u nderstanding how to improve these self -selection systems further is important for \nresearch, especially if they allow households the flexibility of when to apply for a program so that they \ncan do so when they are most in need of assistance. One important qu estion for future research \nprograms is how communications strategies  need to be done to ensure that more of the poor are aware \nthat they can apply and feel comfortable applying", "article_title": "24", "full_section_title": "", "block_type": "text", "language": "en", "last_edit_date": "2024-01-01", "num_tokens": 244}

Further, while self -selection can have many \npositive benefits, if it is too hard to apply (as we discuss more below), it may have the potential to also \nscreen out the poor. For example, requiring lots of paperwork to apply may be limiting if many of the \npeople you want to reach have limited  literacy. Thus, understanding how to reduce paperwork and \nverification burdens, but also generate self -selection, is another area of needed research that could be \nconsidered under this Initiative.  \n \nFinally, with new technologies (e.g., cell phones, web -based systems), one could introduce different \nforms of application systems that could potentially increase access.

If governments try to use this information \nfor community -based targeting , is the outcome better than a proxy -means test -based approach in terms \nof reaching the poor \u2014potentially defined differently by local communities \u2014and in terms of social \ncohesion ? \n \nTo examine this, Alatas et al. (2012)  experimentally compared proxy -means test -based targeting to \ncommunity -based targeting. The results suggest that the optimal approach may depend on the \ngovernment\u2019s goals and metrics of success. On the one hand, the authors found that the proxy -means \ntest did somewhat better at identifying households based on per -capita consumption, although the \nhouseholds whose identification switched were sufficiently close to the poverty line that both approaches \nwould perform similarly in terms of most metrics of need. However, community targeting did \nsubstantially better in terms of identifying households who self -identify as poor", "article_title": "24", "full_section_title": "", "block_type": "text", "language": "en", "last_edit_date": "2024-01-01", "num_tokens": 269}

However, there are often concerns \nabout elite capture in community -based targeting. That is, local leaders might disproportionately choose \nthemselves, family members, or others who are not necessarily the most in -need. There is therefore a \npotential theoretical tradeoff between the superior local information and greater capture of these \nprograms by local elites (e.g., Bardhan and Mookherjee 2000) .  \n \nEmpirically, however, elite capture seems to be small, at least in comparison to other sources of targeting \nfailures.

For example, Alatas et al.

This suggests that the micro -structure of the \nalgorithm used to elicit  the community ranking can affect the accuracy of the overall community ranking, \nand understanding this better can help improve how to collect community information. Second, does the \nefficacy of community targeting differ systematically? For example, Alatas et al. (2016)  finds that the \ncommunity targeting treatment was more effective at identifying households in areas with more diffusive \ninter-personal network structures  (i.e., communities where information spreads more rapidly  across \npeople ). More generally, being able to predict in which types of locations community -based targeting is \nlikely to be most effective is an important research direction.  \n \nA third important research question is whether and how community -based targeting can be compatible \nwith cross -community targeting. That is, one can allocate a fixed number of slots to a community (for \nexample, based on geographic targeting, a past census, or another PMT approach), and ask the \ncommunity to choose which households should receive those slots", "article_title": "24", "full_section_title": "", "block_type": "text", "language": "en", "last_edit_date": "2024-01-01", "num_tokens": 288}

But if a community is asked to \nidentify who is poor on an absolute level, it has little incentive not to list many people as poor in order to \nmaximize tr ansfers from a higher level of government. Designing incentive -compatible procedures for \ncommunity -based targeting that reveal the level of poverty, not just who is poor, is an important \nmechanism design problem for future research.  \n \n4.1.4: Targeting on Productive Use \nThe discussion thus far has focused primarily on identifying the poor and assigning programs to those \npeople. Implicit in this view is that anti -poverty programs are more effective at increasing well-being \nwhen the household is poorer , and the outcome in question is improving income (or consumption) .  \n \nTargeting is more complicated, however, when different people may derive different benefits from a \nprogram , and you care about channeling  resources beyond just the poverty metric . Imagine that you have \nan irrigation subsidy program for farmers: it is not clear that you want to target the poorest farmers (i.e., \ntheir farms may be too small to benefit from an expensive irrigation system).

Several other studies also find that community -based targeting does worse than proxy -means tests when the desired outcome is per -\ncapita consumption, though these studies do not typically assess their comparative effectiveness vis -a-vis self -assessed welfar e (Stoeffler, Mills, and del \nNinno 2016 in Cameroon; Beaman et al. 2021 in urban Monrovia, Liberia; Dupas, Fafchamps, and Houeix 2022 in urban Cote D\u2019Ivoi re).

One option is to predict who will best benefit based on \nobservable covariates, for example, from a randomized trial. Bhattacharya and Dupas (2012) , for \nexample, consider this approach in the context of subsidies for anti -malarial bednets, where they account \nfor the probability of use of the bednets. More generally, recent work has shown how to use machine \nlearning to do so (e.g., Wager and Athey 2018; Chernozhukov et al. 2018) . Several papers have used \nthese techniques to show how they can identify how to best improve the targeting of immunizations \n(Chernozhukov et al. 2018) , public works programs (Bertrand et al. 2021) , and cash transfers ( Haushofer \net al. 2022) . Caria et al. (2021)  combine this approach with a dynamic experimental design to both \nsimultaneously learn which treatments work best optimally, and which work best for which types of \nrespondents, for job training programs for Syrian refugees in Jordan.  \n \nA second option is to encourage self -selection on the basis of treatment effects. Dupas et al. (2016) , for \nexample, investigate a program that provides free chlorine in Kenya, where there are concerns that some \nmay not use the chlorine. They compare free distribution of chlorine vs. distribution of vouchers \nredeemable at nearby shops for free chlorine.

Indeed, they find \nsimilar rates of chlorine in water in the two groups, yet the vouchers saved 60 percent of the cost by not  \ndistributing chlorine to those who would not bother to use it.  \n \nThese examples illustrate the potential to apply these approaches to social protection more broadly. For \nexample, the Graduation approach (discussed above ) may be appropriate for some types of households \nand not others; can one identify them based on ex -ante characteristics? Or find a way for people to self -\nselect in? On the flip side, for social insurance products, one does not want to encourage either adv erse \nselection or so -called \u201cselection on moral hazard \u201d (Einav et al. 2013) .

In the context of cash \ntransfers, for example, some have proposed a universal basic income (UBI) program or a universal in -\nkind program, where each individual receives a fixed amount of money or goods \u2014regardless of \nincome \u2014which is financed through proportional or progressive taxation. In the context of life -cycle \ntransfers, some transfers are open to all who meet categorical eligibilit y (e.g. , all children, all elderly) \nwithout any income restrictions.  \n \nUniversal transfers have several advantages. First, in principle, they have no exclusion error. Note, \nhowever, in practice take -up may be far from universal even for a program with universal eligibility. For \nexample, while there is universal access, some p rograms have an application process to apply. People \nmay not know of their benefits and not try to receive them. Also, if government budgets for the program \nare limited, despite being nominally a universal program, many people may be put on waitlists or be   \n \nJ-PAL-CID Social Protection Initiative Evidence Review  | povertyactionlab.org  \n 56 arbitrarily turned down. Nevertheless, since many more people receive the program, they avoid \nhorizontal inequality and fairness problems (i.e., the challenge that similar people may not receive like \nbenefits).  \n \nSecond, universal programs also ha ve the potential to reduce administrative costs by not needing to \ncollect data on households", "article_title": "24", "full_section_title": "", "block_type": "text", "language": "en", "last_edit_date": "2024-01-01", "num_tokens": 292}
{"id": "24_135", "content_string": ". As a practical matter, however, these costs are usually very small compared \nto the benefits being given out.  \n \nThird, as benefits do not rely on earned income, one may be less likely to work less to keep one\u2019s \nbenefits, and thus we would expect fewer labor supply effects than from targeted programs. There  \ncould still be income effects (as in targeted transfers as well), where people work less since they have \nadditional income from the benefits. However, this may be less relevant for many of the middle - and \nlow-income countries where these income effects hav e been shown to be more limited in magnitude, at \nleast for the types of transfers sizes that are more common. Thus, on net, we would expect few labor \nsupply distortions.  \n \nFourth , universal programs, by eliminating targeting, may reduce the scope for abuse of power (Banerjee, \nNiehaus, and Suri 2019) . \n \nBut perhaps the largest arguments for and against universal programs come down to budgets. For \nexample, let\u2019s start with a simple case where the budget is fixed: in this case, one would mechanically \ndivide what one gives out as a transfer by more people. Thus, more universal programs typically transfer \nsubstantially less resources to each beneficiary than targeted programs. A second case would be to \nincrease the budget to cover the cost of providing transfers to all, but this means that solving the \nexclusio n error problem in this way can be quite expensive (Hoynes and Rothstein 2019)", "article_title": "24", "full_section_title": "", "block_type": "text", "language": "en", "last_edit_date": "2024-01-01", "num_tokens": 316}

In high -income \ncountries, one might increase the tax rate on the wealthy to reduce the net tran sfer. However, in low - \nand middle -income countries, it is  not easy to tax back given the large share of the informal economy  \nand tax collection rates remain generally weak . As a result, universal programs end up giving the same net \ntransfer quite high up the income distribution in low- and middle -income  count ries (Hanna and Olken \n2018) . This makes universal programs particularly expensive relative to targeted programs.   \n \nNote , however, the budget constraint may not be fixed:  for example, if  the relationship between the total \nbudget and the number of beneficiaries increases, universal transfers may become more attractive \npolitically (Klasen and Lange 2016 ; Moene and Wallerstein 2001; Pritchett 2005 ). Indeed, many have \nargued that the durability of some social protection programs like Social Security and Medicare in the \nUnited States comes from their universal eligibility, which makes them politically popular.

In many low - and middle -income countries, the authentication of beneficiaries and \npayments systems are manual: there is a list of beneficiaries, and some local official needs to verify who \nreceives benefits, and cash is given. This makes it hard for the central government to monitor whether \nbenefi ciaries get their full payment, or get a payment at all.  \n \nSeveral studies have examined the implications of digitizing this process.

A third study indicates that digital \nvouchers could affect the relative well -being of women within the households, not just the household as \na whole: Aker et al. (2016)  shows that in Niger, delivering cash transfers through mobile money \nincreased women\u2019s bargaining power within the household, by making the transfer less observable to \nhousehold members.  \n \nA word of caution though: Muralidharan, Niehaus, and Sukhtankar (2020)  showed that reform in \nJharkhand, India, that began to require biometric authentication for the subsidized food program had the \nunfortunate side effect of dropping many poor people from the system who had not linked their \nbiometric information to their foo d benefits account.

These findings  emphasize the need for universal access and robust administrative \ndata before attempting these types of reforms.  \n \nFinally, it is worth noting that the degree to which people prefer digital systems may depend on the \noverall level of adoption of those systems in the country more broadly.

However, it is worth noting that these programs must also be done with care. \nFor example, the reform studied  by Banerjee et al. (2020)  also delayed payments to beneficiaries. \nSimilarly, Muralidharan, Niehaus, and Sukhtankar (2020)  note in their study of Jharkhand that when the \ngovernment transitioned to a system where payments were only made against biometrically authenticated \npayments, it ended up underpaying in some areas where there was not enough of a historical record", "article_title": "24", "full_section_title": "", "block_type": "text", "language": "en", "last_edit_date": "2024-01-01", "num_tokens": 318}

If money is spent differently in the household depending on who \nreceives it, then who is the recipient matters for policy.

They find no \ndifferences in child health or education outcomes on average. That said, they do find that giving transfers \nto mothers leads to lower levels of child labor. They also find some evidence that giving money to \nfathers improves outcomes in poor rainfall years, and leads to  more household investment in livestock, \ncash crops, and housing.31  \n \nLikewise, Haushofer and Shapiro (2016) , in their study of unconditional cash transfers in Kenya, \nrandomize the recipient to be men or women, and again find few differences on average.

GBV is \ndefined by UN Women (n.d.) to be  \u201charmful acts directed at an individual or a group of individuals \nbased on their gender \u201d. \n \nSocial assistance  programs could affect GBV in different ways. For instance, by ensuring financial \nsecurity to households, they may reduce poverty -related stress in the household and thereby decrease \nGBV. This effect may be reinforced if lower levels of stress reduce the ad option of coping mechanisms \nthat are also associated with GBV, such as alcohol consumption. Further, social assistance  transfers may \nincrease women\u2019s bargaining power within the household, discouraging men from engaging in intimate -\npartne r violence (IPV), a form of GBV. On the other hand, if household members disagree about the \noptimal allocation of the transfers or if spouses feel threatened by their wives\u2019 higher levels of economic \nempowerment, one worries that violence could increase.  \n \nThe evidence on social assistance  effects on GBV is mixed. CCTs, UCTs, vouchers, in -kind transfers, a \ncash-plus intervention, and a public works program have decreased or attenuated GBV in Colombia, \nEcuador, Ghana, Kenya, Mexico, South Africa, and Bangladesh (Perova 2010; Hidrobo, Peterman, and \nHeise 2016; Haushofer et al", "article_title": "24", "full_section_title": "", "block_type": "text", "language": "en", "last_edit_date": "2024-01-01", "num_tokens": 343}

Some studies even found that social \nassistance  programs increased GBV for all or specific groups of women (Amaral, Bandyopadhyay, and \nSensarma 2015; Angelucci, Heath, and Noble 2022; Hidrobo and Fernald 2013) . \n \nGiven these mixed results, understanding the heterogeneity in these effects \u2014i.e., how to effectively \ndesign programs to reduce GBV \u2014is therefore an important area for future research. A number of \nstudies have begun to explore which dimensions of program design may be important to ensuring that \nthese programs can work to decrease GBV.  \n \nFor example, Hidrobo, Peterman, and Heise (2016)  shed light on whether the mode of transfer affects \nGBV differently.

They \ninterpret this result as suggestive evidence that violence was not used to forcefully extract resources \u2014\nhad that been the case, cash recipients, whose spending options were less restricted and who were \ntherefore more exposed to conflict over use of the transfer,  would have experienced more violence.  \n \nSeveral studies suggest that coupling transfers with increased community -level interactions may help \nreduce IPV. In Bangladesh, Roy et al. (2019)  found that cash and food transfers also led to similar effects \non emotional and physical IPV: there were no impacts when cash or in -kind transfers were provided \nalone, but physical violence reduced by 6 -7 percentage points if the transfers were combined w ith an \nintensive group -based training on best practices to improve nutrition (a 26 percent decrease relative to \n \n \n32 A review by Buller et al.

Along the same li nes, evidence from Nigeria (Cullen et al. 2020)  \nshows that combining cash transfers with a community -level livelihoods program decreased sexual IPV, \nwhereas transfers alone increased sexual IPV.  \n \nWhen transfers are offered in the form of public works programs, one more aspect must be considered: \ndoes the work requirement reinforce the backlash mechanism, with husbands responding to their wives\u2019 \nemployment with more violence? Or does it reduce viole nce by increasing women\u2019s bargaining power33 \nor limiting time spent with partners?

In Laos, a workfare program increased \nwomen\u2019s income but did not affect GBV (Perova et al. 2021) . \n \nOther features of the program may matter. First, the size of the transfer may matter: Angelucci (2008)  \nshows that small CCT transfers given to women reduced IPV by 37 percent for all households, but large \ntransfers sparked aggressive behavior among less -educated husbands.

In that context, the effects of a cash transfer offered to mothers on IPV varied with women\u2019s \neducation and their education relative to their partners\u2019.

Many households risk large shocks to income, shocks to health, \nchanging opportunities for work, loss of land and /or housing loss , and displacement. For instance, \nBurgess et al.

As example s, agricultural \ninsurance that addresses climate risks may be increasingly important as extreme weather shocks increase  \nand property insur ance may be important as people are displaced.  Programs may need to be specially \ndesigned to deal with particularly large or aggregate shocks, and it is possible that new types of programs \nmay need to be designed specifically for climate -related risks not covered by other programs (e.g., due to \nheat).  \n \nSecond, there can be a role for social protection programs in helping encourage behavior that can reduce \nclimate -change related activities", "article_title": "24", "full_section_title": "", "block_type": "text", "language": "en", "last_edit_date": "2024-01-01", "num_tokens": 300}

INTERLINKAGES ACROSS PROGRAMS  \nIn this  section , we take a step back and think about the interaction of various social protection programs \ninto a coherent system, and as part of this, how the different types of programs  combined can also be \nused to help improve incomes, mitigate risk , and achieve broader social goals . While we discuss many of \nthe programs in this section (and indeed, in earlier sections as well) individually for ease of exposition, \nthe goals and challenges of many of these programs overlap and relate to one another. Moreover, \ngovernment s are often implementing a range of these programs, as they are providing help for different \nneeds , aiming to impact different outcomes,  or affecting individuals at different part s of the life cycle", "article_title": "24", "full_section_title": "", "block_type": "text", "language": "en", "last_edit_date": "2024-01-01", "num_tokens": 294}
{"id": "24_180", "content_string": ". \nThus,  it is important to think through how these programs interact in practice , and how these different \ntiers and layers of social protection support can combine to provide an adequate level of support . \nThroughout, we also talk about the scope for research to help provide guidance in generating policy and \nsystems more broadly that better meet the varying  needs of citizens.   \n \nLife in low - and middle -income countries is risky. Even in high -income countries, adverse selection and \nmoral hazard mean that there is an important justification for government involvement to help \nhouseholds smooth risk, and these countries have substanti al policies and programs that provide \ntransfers, subsidies, and social insurance. However, the additional challenges highlighted above \u2014low \ninsurance demand, low trust, liquidity constraints, challenges of state verification, and informality \u2014mean \nthat even if individuals were offered contracts priced fairly for the entire population, take -up may be low. \nUnderstanding how to solve these issues \u2014and to what degree appropriate government policy may be \neffective \u2014remains an important direction for future work.  \n \nMoreover, the fact that there are these substantial uninsured risks has broader implications for the design \nof social protection systems as a whole. Recall the poverty traps example discussed in Section 2.1.5", "article_title": "24", "full_section_title": "", "block_type": "text", "language": "en", "last_edit_date": "2024-01-01", "num_tokens": 264}

A \nfurther implication of the poverty trap idea is that for a household in the \u201cgood \u201d equilibrium, an \nuninsured negative shock can push them across the threshold and into the bad equilibrium, where they \nmay spiral down into further poverty. This implies that solving the insurance challenges discussed h ere \nmay have spillover effects, reducing the number of people who need social assistance programs to ensure \nbasic livelihoods . Indeed, Ikegami et al. (2018)  and Janzen, Carter, and Ikegami (2021)  argue that, for this \nreason, in a dynamic sense governments may be better off diverting some of their standard targeted \nsocial protection funds to providing additional social insurance. Even to the extent these programs do \nnot solve the entire financial s hock, the conditionalities in some of these programs can direct households \nto smooth them in ways that are less socially costly, i.e. , by encouraging them to keep children in school \n(de Janvry et al. 2006) . This can have similar inter -generational protective effects, preventing a shock in \none generation from creating a long -run cycle of poverty.  \n \nConversely, to the extent that households are receiving social assistance, this may provide an income \nfloor such that a given income shock does push them as close to extreme poverty", "article_title": "24", "full_section_title": "", "block_type": "text", "language": "en", "last_edit_date": "2024-01-01", "num_tokens": 283}

This only works, \nhowever, to the degree that the relevant households are receiving so cial assistance, either through \nuniversal or categorically -eligible programs  or having been found to be eligible previous in a poverty -\ntargeted program.  \n  \n \nJ-PAL-CID Social Protection Initiative Evidence Review  | povertyactionlab.org  \n 74 The previous discussion suggests several ways in which existing social protection programs can become \neven more shock responsive. At the individual level, to the extent that governments can use targeting  it \ncan be more  responsive . For example , by using some combination of high -frequency administrative \ndata such as electricity and mobile phone usage, on -demand applications, and community -driven \napproaches to verify shocks, the same programs that provide assistance to those who need income \nsupport can also provide assistance to those who have experienced shocks, and hence can help fill some \nof the gaps in insurance highlighted in this section. As described above, this works to the extent  that the \ngovernment wants to help people who fall into poverty or near -poverty due to shocks; this approach \ndoes not work for middle classes households who experience negative shocks that make them much \nworse off, but still remain middle class", "article_title": "24", "full_section_title": "", "block_type": "text", "language": "en", "last_edit_date": "2024-01-01", "num_tokens": 251}
{"id": "24_183", "content_string": ".  \n \nAt the aggregate level, governments can use the types of programs discussed in Section 2 to respond to \naggregate shocks by changing the eligibility thresholds  to include more people , or by increasing \ntransfer amount s. For example, the government of Kenya explicitly relaxes eligibility rules for its food \nsecurity program in time of drought to make it more responsive (Gardner et al. 2017) . All households in \nthe four counties covered by the Hunger Safety Net Program were registered during the expansion of \nthis program, regardless of eligibility status, to facilitate efforts to rapidly scale up the transfer during \nemergencies. This has allow ed 50 to 75 percent of the population in these counties to receive cash \ntransfers during droughts.  \n \nDuring the C ovid-19 crisis, when this was an extreme issue, many countries responded in creative ways \nto adapt their existing programs, many of which were of the type discussed in Section 2, to address these \nissues. Indonesia, for example, both relaxed the eligibility rules and expanded the amount of transfers in \nits food voucher program, as well as created a new community -targeted cash transfer program in all rural \nvillages. Pakistan, for e xample, built on its flagship cash transfer program for women, expanding \neligibilit y and using cell -phone metadata to help determine eligibility (Lone et al. 2021) .

THE POLITICS OF SOCIAL PROTECTION PROGRAMS  \nTo run a social protection system or program, one cannot abstract away from the politics. Politics affects \ndifferent aspects of how programs operate in practice, as voters make decisions about the overall level of \nredistribution they want and the form of it. Differences in who has political power , voice , and access \nmay further determine how programs are designed and who ultimately benefits from them", "article_title": "24", "full_section_title": "", "block_type": "text", "language": "en", "last_edit_date": "2024-01-01", "num_tokens": 214}
{"id": "24_186", "content_string": ". And, as with \nany government program, there are interesting dynamics in how politicians think about these \nprograms \u2014do they design platforms on social protection to address voters\u2019 views and needs  (as well as \nwhich voters \u2019 needs) ? Or, do incumbents manipulate the programs by, for example, changing programs \nto shore up support with certain groups prior to elections?  \n \nWhile we cannot comprehensively review the entire politics literature on this topic here due to lack of \nspace, we highlight a few of the issues below, particularly how it relates to the Initiative  funding \ncompetitions. For a broader view, we also refer the interested reader to the review by Golden and Min \n(2013)  for a discussion of related issues from the political science perspective.  \n6.1: VOTERS  \nThe existence or receipt of social protection programs may affect voter behavior \u2014either positively or \nnegatively. For example, some voters may reward parties or politicians that introduce or improve these \nprograms due to a stated preference towards greater redistribution \u2014regardless of whether they actually \nreceive benefits. Moreover, v oters who receive these programs may reward the parties that implement \nthem either because they are happy with the services and help that they are receiving from the \ngovernmen t, or because they are dependent on the help and would want the programs to continue", "article_title": "24", "full_section_title": "", "block_type": "text", "language": "en", "last_edit_date": "2024-01-01", "num_tokens": 276}
{"id": "24_187", "content_string": ". On \nthe other hand, others may vote against those that implement these programs, either due to an inherent \npreference against redistribution, because they are not benefiti ng directly from these programs, or \nbecause they believe that the quality of the programs is poor and they are not reaching the right people.  \n \nA number of studies have looked at whether the introduction or expansions of social protection can \ninduce political participation and/or change voting patterns. This is empirically hard to disentangle, as \nvoting may induce the introduction of social protec tion as well. A number of different empirical \nstrategies have been used to understand these issues.34 \n \nSeveral studies use regression discontinuity designs that compare those who are just above the poverty \neligibility cutoff with those just below to understand the impact of receiving a transfer versus missing \nout. These papers have typically concluded that directly receiving benefits  leads to increased political \nengagement and political support for those who designed or implemented the program. One such study \nis Manacorda, Miguel, and Vigorito (2011) , which studies PANES, a large targeted temporary cash \n \n \n34 One conceptual issue which plagues all of these studies is that there is a tension between empirical identification and what one would expect from \nrational voters", "article_title": "24", "full_section_title": "", "block_type": "text", "language": "en", "last_edit_date": "2024-01-01", "num_tokens": 263}
{"id": "24_188", "content_string": ". In order to generate causal identification of the impact of a policy on electoral outcomes,  one needs random or quasi -random \nallocation of programs to some areas or people and not to others. But, if voters understood this, they would know that the on ly reason that a \ntreatment area or person received the program and a control did not was due to r andom chance; that is, it was not due to any action of the politician. \nSo, a rational voter, even one who would reward politicians who help them, should not reward a politician for having been ran domly allocated to a \ntreatment group.   \n \nJ-PAL-CID Social Protection Initiative Evidence Review  | povertyactionlab.org  \n 77 program in Uruguay. Using survey data on voting outcomes, the authors find that beneficiaries were \nmore likely to favor the government that implemented PANES. This was true even after the program \nitself ended, suggesting that it was less about people votin g based on their current receipt of benefits but \nperhaps due to a change in belief about the party\u2019s beliefs on redistribution.  \n \nA second study employing these methods was Pop-Eleches and Pop -Eleches (2012)  that studied a 200  \nEuro  coupon to poor families for the purchase of a computer  in Romania . They also found that \nbeneficiaries were more likely to support the incumbent government coalition, driven by both high \nmobilization and also party -switching", "article_title": "24", "full_section_title": "", "block_type": "text", "language": "en", "last_edit_date": "2024-01-01", "num_tokens": 301}
{"id": "24_189", "content_string": ". But, interestingly, the higher trust was only to the local \ngovernment officials who administered  the program, but not the central government that designed and \nfunded the program. A final example is from Colombia\u2019s CCT program, Familias en Acci\u00f3n. Conover et \nal. (2020)  explored discontinuities in program eligibility and variation in program enrollment across \nvoting booths and find that the program increased the beneficiaries\u2019 probability to register to vote, \nespecially for women, who were the direct recipients of the pr ogram.  \n \nA series of other papers examined experimental variation in the roll -out of transfers programs to look at \ntheir effect on political outcomes of everyone, regardless of whether they received the program . The results are \nmixed. For example, Labonne (2013)  shows that a CCT program in the Philippines also led to increased \nvote share for the incumbent, but this effect was only evident in municipalities where there were high \nlevels of political competition. Blattman, Emeriau, and Fiala (2018) , however, examine a randomized \nallocation of grants to youth to fund entrepreneurship activities in Uganda, and find no effects on \nsupport for the ruling party.35 Likewise, Imai, King, and Velasco Rivera (2020)  find no electoral impact of \na large -scale randomized trial in Mexico which randomized health insurance to selected areas (discussed \nabove)", "article_title": "24", "full_section_title": "", "block_type": "text", "language": "en", "last_edit_date": "2024-01-01", "num_tokens": 294}
{"id": "24_190", "content_string": ".  \n \nBrollo, Kaufmann, and La Ferrara (2020)  show that beneficiaries may react to specific program features, \nnot only the program as a whole. Using random variation in the timing of when beneficiaries learned \nabout penalties for noncompliance with Bolsa Familia\u2019s  conditionalities around the 2008 municipal \nelections, they find a lower vote share for candidates aligned with the president in areas where more \nbeneficiaries received penalties shortly before (as opposed to shortly after) the elections.  \n \n6.2: POLITICIANS  \nA key question is how politicians develop social protection programs and policies based on political \nincentives. The best case, but overly simplistic, scenario is that voters have preferences for redistribution \nand the design of such policies and programs,  they make their voices heard through activism and voting, \nand politicians respond by providing the types of programs that citizens need. However, there are many \nchallenges here \u2014as citizen voices are not always aggregated perfectly through the voting booth , with \nthose who may be most vulnerable often excluded from the systems. To gain support with particular \n \n \n35 There is also a literature examining the electoral consequences of Progresa in Mexico", "article_title": "24", "full_section_title": "", "block_type": "text", "language": "en", "last_edit_date": "2024-01-01", "num_tokens": 248}
{"id": "24_191", "content_string": ". The challenge in doing so, as pointed out by Green (2006) and \ndiscussed in our discussion of Progresa above, is that Progresa treated the control areas too, and so the randomized trial compares areas that received \nProgresa for ~30 months prior to the election to areas that received it 6 months prior. Imai, King, and Velasco Rivera (2020)  show that once data \nerrors in the original De La O (2013)  study of the electoral consequences of the Progresa RCT are corrected, there is no effect of Progresa on \nelectoral vote share. Imai, King, and Velasco Rivera (2020)  also use an alternative, discontinuity -based design and again find no impact of Progresa on \nvote shares.   \n \nJ-PAL-CID Social Protection Initiative Evidence Review  | povertyactionlab.org  \n 78 voters or groups, politicians may also change spending patterns or manipulate rules or programs to \nconfer benefits to certain groups.  \n \nA number of papers aim to understand whether politicians strategically time spending around elections, \nwhich could have implications for general macroeconomic conditions (e.g., too much spending in good \ntimes, and thus limitations in available budget to in crease spending in recessions), following on the work \nof Nordhaus (1975) . For example, Khemani (2004)  found that, in India, public investment increased \nmore before scheduled investments, but then contracted in other times to keep the net balance \nunchanged", "article_title": "24", "full_section_title": "", "block_type": "text", "language": "en", "last_edit_date": "2024-01-01", "num_tokens": 321}
{"id": "24_192", "content_string": ". Composition of spending changed too, as Khemani (2004)  found that resources shifted to \nnarrow interest groups (e.g., tax breaks provided to small groups of producers) rather than broad -based \nconsumption spending. Drazen and Eslava (2010)  also found, for Colombia, that the composition of \nspending changed before elections, particularly around targeted expenditures.  \n \nIn addition to changing spending patterns, politicians can also adjust the rules or implementation of \nexisting programs to target particular groups and voters. For example, Camacho and Conover (2011) , \ndiscussed above, finds evidence of manipulation of the targeting rules before elections, while Brollo, \nKaufmann, and La Ferrara (2020) , also discussed above, finds that enforcement of CCT rules becomes \nmore lax before elections in municipalities where the incumbent associated with the program could run \nfor reelection.  \n \nGiven the political context, can improving representation and voice improve incentives for politicians? \nCan it shift policies and programs towards the previously unrepresented groups? A number of papers \nimplies that it can. For example, Pande (2003)  and Chattopadhyay and Duflo (2004)  find that improving \nrepresentation of minorities and women in India through political reservations led to spending \nallocations that better mirrored citizens\u2019 preferences", "article_title": "24", "full_section_title": "", "block_type": "text", "language": "en", "last_edit_date": "2024-01-01", "num_tokens": 281}
{"id": "24_193", "content_string": ". Similarly, Fujiwara (2015)  found that increasing the \nenfranchisement of less educated citizens through electronic voting led to increased spending towards \nhealth care, which benefits low -income populations.  \n \nNote, however, that spending decisions \u2014even if they align well with voters \u2014may come at a cost in \nterms of other human capital investments. For example, Bursztyn (2016)  found that governments \ninvested less in public education because lower -income decisive voters preferred them to allocate \nresources mostly toward redistributive programs, such as cash transfers. This could potentially be welfare \nenhancing if, for example, public systems are poor and households decide how to invest in their child\u2019s \neducation through private systems that improve education. However, it could also come at a cost if \nparents do not fully take into account the full benefits of education for their children and underinvest in \nschooling, or if other challenges \u2014pressure from other family members for funds, other immediate \nspending needs \u2014also lead to an underinvestment in education.

CONCLUSIONS  \nSocial protection programs are becoming increasingly prominent in low - and middle -income countries \nworldwide. This is partly due to the fact that countries are becoming richer, and so countries that were \nrecently quite poor are now middle -income, and with substantially larger tax bases are able to fund more \nsophisticated systems. But, it also reflects the fact that, conditional on a country\u2019s income level, countries \nare more likely to have systems in place that provide assistance to the poor, and social ins urance of a \nvariety of types, than they were fifty or even twenty years ago.  \n \nBut the fundamental nature of some of these countries\u2019 economies \u2014such as the large informal sector, \nand the deep absolute poverty level of the poor \u2014means that the way these programs are designed \ndiffers in fundamental ways from the way they are designed in high -income countries. Th is also \nhighlights the need for research that is specific to these contexts, and that is designed to meet the policy \nchallenges that low - and middle - income countries are actually facing", "article_title": "24", "full_section_title": "", "block_type": "text", "language": "en", "last_edit_date": "2024-01-01", "num_tokens": 311}

Given the significant heterogeneity \nin low - and middle -income countries, it is important that future research evaluates policy challenges in a \nvariety of contexts, with different degrees of poverty and informality. This piece sets out to review the \nexisting literature, and also highlight the research gaps that the J -PAL-CID Social Protection Initiative \naims to help fill.   \n \n   \n \nJ-PAL-CID Social Protection Initiative Evidence Review  | povertyactionlab.org  \n 81 REFERENCES  \nAbelson, Brian, Kush R.

The Finance Minister, in his budget speech for 2014 -15, laid out a specific set of targets to \nprovide for financial accounts to every household by  August 2015. This ambitious target set the tone \nas well as highlighted the importance of attaining it within a specified timeframe. Taking the ambition \nfurther, in his maiden Independence Day speech, the Prime Minister announced the Pradhan Mantri \nJan\u2013Dhan Yojana (PMJDY) with an objective of opening no -frills bank accounts. The PMJDY was \nlaunched immediately after this announcement on August 28. On the inauguration day itself, 1.5 crore \nbank accounts were opened. Within three months, the figure multiplied to 7.5 crore across India. This \nmust be recognised as a remarkable achievement", "article_title": "AdvacingFinancialInclusionInIndia", "full_section_title": "", "block_type": "text", "language": "en", "last_edit_date": "2024-01-01", "num_tokens": 309}
{"id": "AdvacingFinancialInclusionInIndia_5", "content_string": ".  \nThe focus of financial inclusion in India thus far has overwhelmingly been on delivering credit through \nmicrofinance channels, state -owned banks and through state -promoted self  help groups. The PMJDY \nhas complemented these efforts by forcefully accelerating the previous efforts of the Reserve Bank of \nIndia (RBI) of promoting financial inclusion through facilitating opening of bank accounts. The \nPMJDY provides basic zero -balance bank accounts with accident insurance cover of 1 lakh, along \nwith an overdraft facility of Rs 5,000 available for account holders. The scheme would also facilitate \nthe use of mobile banking among the poor through the National Unified USSD Platform (NUUP). \nThe NUUP would allow customers to access banking services using a single number across all banks, \nirrespective of the telecom provider or mobile handset being used (National Payments Corporation \nof India, 2014). The launch of this scheme received strong su pport from public sector and private \nsector commercial banks, resulting in significant uptake. With the provision of insurance and transfer \nfacilities along with the overdraft facilities under PMJDY, there is a clear focus on expanding the \nportfolio of fin ancial instruments available to all households in the country (Pradhan Mantri Jan \u2013\nDhan Yojana, 2014)", "article_title": "AdvacingFinancialInclusionInIndia", "full_section_title": "", "block_type": "text", "language": "en", "last_edit_date": "2024-01-01", "num_tokens": 271}

The committee, whose objective was to provide a clear vision for financial \ninclusion, prepared a report highlighting key areas of concern.

{"id": "AdvacingFinancialInclusionInIndia_7", "content_string": ".  \n \nA Brief Background of Financial Inclusion in India   \nAfter the World Wars, most developed nations vigorously implemented rural finance policies, which \nfocused primarily on the provision of subsidised credit to the rural population, through state -\ncontrolled or directed institutions. Indian policies on rural f inance have mirrored the worldwide \npattern since the 1950s with the implementation of various forms of subsidised credit schemes, \nincluding the mammoth Integrated Rural Development Programme (IRDP). The basis of extending \nsubsidised credit is the theory in  development economics which claims that access to capital can lead \nto increased income and reduced poverty. The critical assumption of that model is that all households \nhave a project to invest in and it is only the lack of collateral that prevents banks from lending to the \npoor. It was exactly this fundamental logic which led to the innovation of different kinds of collateral \nsubstitutes like joint liability which formed the basis for the microcredit revolution worldwide, \nparticularly in South Asia.  \nHowe ver, it is now well recognized that financial needs of the \u2018excluded\u2019 segments of the economy go \nbeyond access to credit. Improved access to various formal financial services includes safe instruments \nfor savings, easy -to-understand insurance instruments, and pension and transfer facilities, among \nothers", "article_title": "AdvacingFinancialInclusionInIndia", "full_section_title": "", "block_type": "text", "language": "en", "last_edit_date": "2024-01-01", "num_tokens": 265}
{"id": "AdvacingFinancialInclusionInIndia_8", "content_string": ". These can enable consumption smoothing, building an asset base which can facilitate future \naccess to credit and risk management and be used for self -investment in micro enterprises.  \nThe main demand -side b arriers to the provision of financial services to the poor are the lack of \nawareness, limited financial literacy, and limited access. Most products offered by banks are unsuitable                                                                                                                              Brookings India IMPACT Series   \n   \n5 \n for the poor and come attached with terms and conditions which prove to be b urdensome, further \ndampening the demand for these services. At the same time, as recent events (for example, the Saradha \nscam) have shown, lack of financial literacy can result in people making wrong choices, and becoming \nvulnerable to excessive financial risks.  \nFrom the supply side, the main barrier to the provision of formal financial services is transaction cost. \nData reveals that a large number of bank accounts are underused, which makes creating and \nmaintaining such accounts cost -ineffective for the b anks. From the credit perspective, the lack of \ncollateral makes lending to small borrowers costly for banks and other formal financial institutions. \nSmall ticket sizes add to the per instrument transaction costs. Furthermore, lacunae in physical and \nlegal infrastructure make it difficult to extend and enforce contracts", "article_title": "AdvacingFinancialInclusionInIndia", "full_section_title": "", "block_type": "text", "language": "en", "last_edit_date": "2024-01-01", "num_tokens": 271}
{"id": "AdvacingFinancialInclusionInIndia_9", "content_string": ".  \n \nWhat do the poor want?  \nMost of the poor, urban and rural, lack access to basic financial services and address their need for \nfinancial products through informal means which are costly and unsecure. Financial inclusion aims to \nreduce such risks, and provide safer options to them, but over the years the various policies adopted \nby the government to increase the presence of banks in remote rural areas have still not been able to \ncover the majo rity of the population. Those who have been provided with no -frills bank accounts lack \nthe incentive to utilize these accounts to save money. Most of the strategies of the government in \npromoting financial inclusion have been centred on the provision of ba nk accounts in order to \nfacilitate credit to the poor. The provision of credit, though important, is not the only means through \nwhich the poor can be included in the economy through financial services.  \nUnderstanding how the poor earn and manage their mone y can help in designing better instruments \nand institutions to address their financial needs. In Portfolios of the Poor , Collins et al. (2009) aim to do \nthis through the use of \u2018financial diaries\u2019.  The authors interviewed poor households in Bangladesh, \nIndia, and South Africa twice a month for a year, asking a series of questions which were then \nconstructed into \u2018financial diaries\u2019 to understand how the poor spent their money", "article_title": "AdvacingFinancialInclusionInIndia", "full_section_title": "", "block_type": "text", "language": "en", "last_edit_date": "2024-01-01", "num_tokens": 288}

The poor in \ndeveloping countries like India, face three main issues or a \u2018triple  whammy\u2019 \u2014 low incomes, lack of \nappropriate financial tools, and unpredictable outcomes. It is these challenges which financial Advancing Financial Inclusion in India beyond the Jan -Dhan Yojana  \n  \n \n6 \n inclusion initiatives must address. This research found three main areas where poor households would \nfrequently find the need to  generate resources through financial tools . \nLump sums of cash : In order to invest in microenterprises and agricultural activities, the poor need to \ngenerate large sums of money to purchase fertilizers or invest in human capital such as healthcare, \nschool fees and weddings. However, there are constraints on the ability to generate such large sums. \nHence, they require financial instruments that meet these needs by helping them \u2018save up\u2019 to a lump \nsum amount.  \nDaily expenditure : Funding for day -to-day expendi ture is a need that the poor face, and is often \nunaddressed by the financial institutions, unlike the provision of lump sum of money. This need is \nmost acute for those farmers who receive a few lump sums over the year. However, these sums of \nmoney are almo st immediately used up. There is a need to set some money aside in the months of no \nincome and also for future expenditure. This need is also important for other categories of workers \nwho receive intermittent income, like daily labourers, in order to bridg e gaps in earnings", "article_title": "AdvacingFinancialInclusionInIndia", "full_section_title": "", "block_type": "text", "language": "en", "last_edit_date": "2024-01-01", "num_tokens": 312}
{"id": "AdvacingFinancialInclusionInIndia_11", "content_string": ". Therefore, \nthe provision of financial services, such as savings bank accounts, can be instrumental in cash flow \nmanagement for households. Having secure and accessible savings accounts can help them in \nconsumption smoothing to a great e xtent.  \nUnexpected circumstances : A situation in which the poor often find themselves unable to provide are \nunavoidable crises like adverse weather conditions and health emergencies. These negative shocks \ndrive the marginal poor back into poverty by forcing  them to resort to borrowing from informal \nsources such as moneylenders or to sell assets. Risk exposure can also dis -incentivi se them from \ninvesting in activities which could yield higher productivity. Access to insurance instruments as well \nas savings ca n provide a buffer in times of extreme shocks such that they don\u2019t resort to costly \nincome \u2013smoothing activities.  \n \nAdvancing Financial Inclusion in India beyond Jan \u2013Dhan Yojana   \nWith most financial inclusion policies in India solely focused on the provision  of bank accounts and \ncredit to the poor, there is a need to include more financial services in the portfolio of national financial \ninclusion strategies to account for the needs of this segment. We highlight some of these below and \nemphasize that they be p rioritized.

Innovation in savings instruments  \nThe financial portfolios of poor households are as diverse as those of their richest peers, with an \naverage of 10 financial instruments per household (Collins et al., 2009). However, the diversity of \nfinancial  instruments offered in India today by commercial finance companies as well as the \ngovernment is limited in scope and scale, particularly to the poorer sections of society. Product design \nis critically important when it comes to developing savings instrume nts for low -income households . \nThe instruments provided and facilitated by the financial  sector, from the government to the banks to \nlocal state authorities must be designed according to the needs of the specific market segment.  \nInternationally, the success of Bank Rakyat Indonesia (BRI) in providing commercially viable financial \nservices \u2013 loans and savings, along with other financial products to the low -income households \u2013 has \nseveral lessons for India. BRI built a customer base  of over 30 million depositors through tailoring \ntheir products and services offered to the needs of the clients, thereby incentivizing them to better \nutilize their savings accounts. BRI accounts are structured in a way which encourages more savings \nthan l oans.

An estimate\nfrom the World Bank posits that approximately 1.7 billion people, primarily residing in\nunderdeveloped countries, are devoid of basic banking facilities, such as checking accounts or\nstandardsavingsproducts( Demirguc-Kuntetal. ,2018). Thissituationstarklycontrastswith\ndeveloped economies like the United States, where a mere 4.5% of households are \u201cunbanked\u201d\n(FDIC,2021). This deprivation from finance could impede economic development by curbing\naggregate investment and employment and distorting capital allocation among firms and\npotential entrepreneurs ( Hsieh and Klenow ,2009;Buera et al. ,2011;Bazzi et al. ,2021;\nFonseca and Matray ,2022).\nMany developing countries have implemented place-based policies to stimulate bank ex-\npansion in lagging regions, believing that these policies have the potential to ignite economic\ngrowth and alleviate poverty through better access to financial services", "article_title": "BankExpansionFirmDynamicsandStructural", "full_section_title": "", "block_type": "text", "language": "en", "last_edit_date": "2024-01-01", "num_tokens": 294}

However, less is un-\nderstood about the costs and aggregate welfare effects of these programs.1It is conceivable\nthat regions under-served by banks could have an inherently low demand for credit, possibly\ndue to low productivity levels or other market frictions.2Under such conditions, expanding\nthe presence of bank branches in places with low credit demand could be counterproductive\nand even lead to greater misallocation of resources.\nIn this study, we investigate the impacts of bank expansion on firm dynamics and labor\nallocation, employing both empirical and theoretical approaches. Our analysis takes advan-\ntage of a nationwide policy experiment in India, which was implemented by the Reserve\nBank of India in 2005.

These policies include priority sector lending ( Banerjee and Duflo ,2014), restrictions on\nForeign Direct Investment (FDI) ( Bau and Matray ,2023), contractual frictions ( Bertrand et al. ,2021), and\nreservationsforSmall-ScaleIndustries( Martinetal. ,2017).

This hypothesis posits that growth in the manufacturing sector could result in\nhigher industrial wages and attract surplus labor from the agricultural sector, thereby driving\nthe structural change ( Lewis,1954;Harris and Todaro ,1970;Bencivenga and Smith ,1997;\nGylfason and Zoega ,2006;Alvarez-Cuadrado and Poschke ,2011)", "article_title": "BankExpansionFirmDynamicsandStructural", "full_section_title": "", "block_type": "text", "language": "en", "last_edit_date": "2024-01-01", "num_tokens": 352}

We conclude with Section 6.\n2 Policy Reform and Identification Strategy\n2.1 Policy and Institutional Background\nThe policy reform we analyze in this study was introduced in 2005 by the Reserve Bank\nof India (RBI) to incentivize banks to open more branches in under-served locations.5As\nper the policy, banks are required to submit an annual branch expansion plan to the RBI,\noutlining proposed branch openings, closings, and shifts. Thus, by proposing to open more\nbranches in areas that the RBI has designated as \u201cunder-banked,\u201d banks can increase their\nchances of obtaining licenses for their preferred locations.6 7\nThe definition of an \u201cunder-banked\u201d district is crucial for our identification strategy.\n5In India, the banking sector does not permit free entry of banks or bank branches. Banks are required\nto apply for and acquire licenses from the RBI prior to opening any new branch. Additionally, banks must\nalso request approval to close or relocate branches in most markets.\n6To make their license-issuance decisions, the RBI also evaluates banks based on other factors, such as\nthe bank\u2019s provision of \u201cno-frills\u201d accounts, adherence to priority sector lending obligations, and complaint\nresolution record", "article_title": "BankExpansionFirmDynamicsandStructural", "full_section_title": "", "block_type": "text", "language": "en", "last_edit_date": "2024-01-01", "num_tokens": 296}

However, these requirements are applied at the bank level, not the individual branch level.\nFor more details on the reform, refer to the 2005 issue of the RBI\u2019s Master Circular on Branch Authorization .\n7Banks in India are not allowed to relocate their branches if they leave a market \u201cunbanked\u201d. Therefore,\nit is not possible for banks to circumvent this policy by opening in under-banked districts and then relocating\nto bank-rich areas.\n5According to the rule adopted by the RBI, a district is considered under-banked if the average\nnumber of people per bank branch (i.e., the population-to-branch ratio) exceeds the national\naverage for India8as follows:\nPopulation Dist.\n#Bank Branches Dist.|{z}\n\u201cUnder \u2212banked District \u201d>Population National\n#Bank Branches National|{z}\n\u201cNational Average \u201d\nIn September 2005, RBI published the list of \u201cunder-banked\u201d districts following the above\nrule, which was then slightly revised in 2006. It is important to note that the RBI did not\nadjust the list to account for changes in the ratio , despite more bank branches having entered\ninto under-banked districts. As a result, the list of \u201cunder-banked\u201d districts remained nearly\nconstant throughout our sample period.9Using the o\ufb00icial RBI document in 2006, we define\n375outof593districtsas\u201cunder-banked\u201ddistricts,whichwerespatiallydispersedthroughout\nthe country.\n2", "article_title": "BankExpansionFirmDynamicsandStructural", "full_section_title": "", "block_type": "text", "language": "en", "last_edit_date": "2024-01-01", "num_tokens": 317}

The identification assumption is that dis-\ntricts close to the cutoff are similar in the absence of bank expansion. In this subsection,\nwe show that the policy provides exogenous variation in the presence of bank branches and\nvalidate our identification strategy. We will further explain our estimating equations along\nwith corresponding results in Section 4and Section 5to avoid confusion.\nTo validate this design, we first show that there is no evidence of manipulation of the\ncutoff\u2014sodistrictsdonotselectintotreatmentorcontrolgroups.

To account for this, we\nindependently recalculated this ratio based on its definition, and we validate the accuracy of our calculations\nin a subsequent section.\n9While the RBI only published the list of under-banked districts without revealing the detailed district-\nlevel population-branch ratios, we reconstruct the ratios using the 2001 population census data and bank\nbranchdata from the RBI. After 2010, certain states were made ineligible for \u201cunder-banked\u201d status, reducing\nthe number of \u201cunder-banked\u201d districts, but no new district was introduced to \u201cunder-banked\u201d status.

The compliance with the assign-\nment rule is not perfect. Out of 578 districts that we have bank branch data, seven districts\nhad a status different than predicted by the population-branch ratio. Several reasons might\nexplain the imperfect compliance. First, there may be measurement error present within the\nbranch data.11Second, the RBI might have used their discretion to edit the list, potentially\nwith the intent to \u201chelp\u201d specific districts, or were captured by political elites", "article_title": "BankExpansionFirmDynamicsandStructural", "full_section_title": "", "block_type": "text", "language": "en", "last_edit_date": "2024-01-01", "num_tokens": 319}

Wealsodemonstrate\nthe robustness of our results by including these observations in a Fuzzy RD design.\nWe further validate our RD design by showing that other covariates and pre-treatment\nvariables are smooth around the cutoff.

Recall that the population-branch ratio has two components: 1) the district population\nin 2001, which was fixed when the expansion policy was announced; and 2) the number of bank branches in\nthe district. To game the policy, banks need to collectively gain RBI\u2019s approval to open or close branches\nat least one year before the policy. It is highly unlikely, as the policy was announced in 2005 without prior\nnotice.\n11The total number of districts in 2001 was 593. For districts that were split from a 2001 district, we\nrecoded them to the original district. Some districts were excluded because they were formed after 2001 by\nmerging several existing districts, making it impossible to map them to previous districts. After a careful\nreview of RBI documents and historical texts, we further excluded three districts due to suspected coding\nerrors or manipulation. Ujjain, a historically wealthy city not initially included in the list of under-banked\ndistricts in 2005, was added in 2006. We suspect this addition might have been politically motivated, and\nhence, we excluded Ujjain. Badgam district was also removed from our sample. There was a transfer of\nlead bank responsibility in respect of Anantnag, Budgam, Pulwama and Srinagar districts to the Jammu &\nKashmir Bank Ltd. up to March 2005. Despite the extension of the existing arrangement until March 31,\n2007, these bank branches were recorded as closed in the RBI bank branch data, reversing the treatment\nstatus of Badgam", "article_title": "BankExpansionFirmDynamicsandStructural", "full_section_title": "", "block_type": "text", "language": "en", "last_edit_date": "2024-01-01", "num_tokens": 333}

Lastly, we dropped Varanasi due to the 2002 merger of the private sector Banaras State\nBank with the nationalized Bank of Baroda. This merger led to some bank branches in Varanasi being coded\nas closed, altering their treatment status.\n7around the cutoff, lending support to the causal interpretation of our RDD results.\nThe reform was highly effective by introducing powerful incentives for banks to open in\ndistricts previously considered unprofitable and thus under-banked, by leveraging licenses in\nhigh-profit areas.12Cramer(2021) andYoung(2017) have also examined this policy and\nshowed that commercial, especially private sector banks, strongly respond to the policy, as\nwe confirm in Figure B.3andB.4. On average, treatment districts received 21% more branch\nlicenses and 19% more branches than control districts by 2010, which corresponds to an\nincrease to 8.31 branches per 100,000 people, compared to the control mean of 6.99 branches\n(Cramer,2021). Furthermore, treatment districts also saw a large increase in deposit and\ncredit after the policy.13\n3 Data\nOur primary source of data is the establishment-level data from the Annual Survey of Indus-\ntries (ASI) from 1998 to 2013.14The ASI provides a representative sample of all registered\nmanufacturing establishments in India, with large establishments covered yearly and smaller\nestablishments surveyed on a sampling basis", "article_title": "BankExpansionFirmDynamicsandStructural", "full_section_title": "", "block_type": "text", "language": "en", "last_edit_date": "2024-01-01", "num_tokens": 309}

Firstly, the lack of access to finance might cause\nhigh costs of operation, such as a fixed cost of using credit, as posited by Ji et al. (2023).\n18Fixed assets include tangible assets such as plants, land, and machinery owned by firms, but exclude\nmining rights and other intangible assets.\n10Consequently, only the more productive and talented entrepreneurs would bear the costs\nand enter the market.19In this case, we would expect that opening more bank branches in\nunder-banked districts could lower the operating costs, promoting the entry of smaller (and\npossibly less productive) firms ( Bazzi et al", "article_title": "BankExpansionFirmDynamicsandStructural", "full_section_title": "", "block_type": "text", "language": "en", "last_edit_date": "2024-01-01", "num_tokens": 306}

This muted credit demand could then discourage the entry of banks into\nthese districts, rendering them \u201cunder-banked\u201d.

The model shows that while we need a high overhead\ncost to rationalize the larger firm size and a smaller number of firms in under-banked dis-\ntricts, the overhead cost cannot be primarily driven by the scarcity of bank branches, which\ncan hardly explain why firm size grew further following the reform.

These patterns suggest that\nsubsistence requirements and the labor supply channel alone are insu\ufb00icient to explain the\nstructural transformation documented in our results.\nThe regression results are reported in Table B.7andB.8. Table B.13and Table B.14\nconfirm that our estimates are similar using levels instead of logs as outcome variables.\nUsing data from the 2001 population census as a placebo test, Table B.10and Table B.11\nshow that the estimates tend to be much smaller and less statistically significant before the\npolicy implementation, thus further support our identification strategy.\n32Intriguingly, we also note a decline in \u2018other workers\u2019 and a non-significant increase in\nagricultural laborers in villages without road connections or those situated further from pop-\nulation centers. This pattern suggests a spatial reallocation of agricultural activities to places\nwith lesser access to industrial job opportunities, echoing the results reported in Madhok et\nal.(2022). This reallocation could be driven by two channels. First, bank expansion could\ndirectly impact agricultural investments and activities, and this effect may be more evident\nin remote and isolated areas. Second, there could be a general equilibrium effect of bank\nexpansion. If farmers in neighboring villages transition to non-agricultural sectors, local\nfood prices could increase, rendering farming more profitable. We plan to assess the relative\nstrength of these two channels in our quantitative exercise", "article_title": "BankExpansionFirmDynamicsandStructural", "full_section_title": "", "block_type": "text", "language": "en", "last_edit_date": "2024-01-01", "num_tokens": 298}

However, contrary to initial expectations, the expansion did not translate\ninto increased firm dynamics or higher entry rates. Moreover, we find that this policy had\nminimal effects on product innovation and total factor productivity. This policy primarily\nbenefited incumbent firms and left potential entrants largely unaffected, hinting at limited\ndynamic gains from bank expansion.\nOn the labor front, we find that bank expansion created more high-paying jobs and led\nto a significant labor reallocation towards the manufacturing sector, particularly in regions\nwith lower agricultural productivity. This labor movement underscores the role of manu-\nfacturing development as a significant \u201clabor pull\u201d factor, shaping the process of structural\ntransformation.\nMoving forward, we plan to delve deeper into these findings by constructing a spatial\ngeneral equilibrium model. This model will help us interpret our empirical results and quan-\ntify the aggregate effects of bank expansion", "article_title": "BankExpansionFirmDynamicsandStructural", "full_section_title": "", "block_type": "text", "language": "en", "last_edit_date": "2024-01-01", "num_tokens": 253}

With this model, we intend to examine the\nconsequences of the reform on aggregate economic growth, resource allocation, and labor\nmobility. We also aim to calibrate this model with the micro-estimates derived from our\ncurrent analysis. Additionally, we aim to explore various policy counterfactuals, such as the\npotential e\ufb00iciency gains from relaxing migration constraints compared to merely increasing\nthe bank presence in underdeveloped regions.\n33References\nAllcott, Hunt, Allan Collard-W exler, and Stephen D O\u2019Connell , \u201cHow do electricity\nshortages affect industry?

The record on \fnancial inclusion, however, has not kept apace. Large amounts of credit\ndo not always correspond to broad use of \fnancial services, as credit is often concentrated among\nthe largest \frms. Moreover, \frms in developing countries evidently continue to face barriers in\naccessing \fnancial services. For instance, 95 percent of \frms in advanced economies have access to\na bank loan or line of credit as compared with 58 percent in developing economies, and 20 percent\nin low-income countries (Figure I). Collateral requirements for loans, which impose borrowing\nconstraints on \frms, are also 2-3 times as high in developing countries as compared to advanced\neconomies. Similarly, interest rate spreads (the di\u000berence between lending and deposit rates) tend\nto be much higher than in advanced economies", "article_title": "DistiguishingFinancialConstraints", "full_section_title": "", "block_type": "text", "language": "en", "last_edit_date": "2024-01-01", "num_tokens": 348}
{"id": "DistiguishingFinancialConstraints_3", "content_string": ". Firms also di\u000ber in terms of their own identi\fcation\nof access to \fnance as a major obstacle to their operations and growth: in developing economies, 35\npercent of small \frms report that access to \fnance is a major obstacle to their operations, compared\nwith 25 percent of large \frms, and 8 percent of large \frms in advanced economies (Figure II).1\nThese considerations warrant a tractable framework that allows for a systematic examination of\nthe linkages between \fnancial inclusion, GDP, and inequality. Moreover, there is a need for better\nunderstanding of the economic channels through which these relationships are sustained. Given\nthat \fnancial inclusion is multi-dimensional, involving both participation barriers and \fnancial\nfrictions that constrain credit availability, policy implications to foster \fnancial inclusion are likely\nto vary across countries. In this paper, we develop a micro-founded general equilibrium model to\naddress these issues. This approach o\u000bers a consistent framework to elucidate the linkages between\n\fnancial inclusion, GDP, and inequality, and to quantify the impact of speci\fc policy changes. This\ncan help guide policy makers in prioritizing between di\u000berent \fnancial sector policies depending\nupon their goals. In the concluding section of this paper, we summarize typical micro level policy\ndiscussions, and our goal is to advance these discussions by tracing out macro general equilibrium\nimpacts.\n[Figure 1 about here", "article_title": "DistiguishingFinancialConstraints", "full_section_title": "", "block_type": "text", "language": "en", "last_edit_date": "2024-01-01", "num_tokens": 317}
{"id": "DistiguishingFinancialConstraints_4", "content_string": ".\n[Figure 1 about here.]\nIn the model, agents are heterogeneous|distinguished from each other by wealth and talent.\nIndividuals choose in each period whether to become an entrepreneur or to supply labor for a wage.\nWorkers supply labor to entrepreneurs and are paid the equilibrium wage. Entrepreneurs have\naccess to a technology that uses capital and labor for production. In equilibrium, only talented\nindividuals with a certain level of wealth choose to become entrepreneurs. Untalented individuals,\nor those who are talented but wealth-constrained, are unable to start a pro\ftable business, choosing\n1This problem is more acute for \frms in the informal sector. In this paper, we focus primarily on formal sector\n\frms.\n2instead to become wage earners. Thus, occupational choices determine how individuals can save\nand also what risks they can bear, with long-run implications for growth and the distribution of\nincome.\n[Figure 2 about here.]\nThe model features an economy with two \\\fnancial regimes\", one with credit and one with\nsavings only. Individuals in the savings regime can save (i.e., make a deposit in \fnancial institutions\nto transfer wealth over time) but cannot borrow. Participation in the savings regime is free, but\nindividuals must pay a participation cost to borrow", "article_title": "DistiguishingFinancialConstraints", "full_section_title": "", "block_type": "text", "language": "en", "last_edit_date": "2024-01-01", "num_tokens": 270}
{"id": "DistiguishingFinancialConstraints_5", "content_string": ". The size of this participation cost is one of\nthe determinants of \fnancial inclusion, capturing the \fxed transactions costs and high annual fees,\ndocumentation requirements, and other access barriers facing \frms in developing countries. This is\nin short a variable which captures the various nuanced dimensions of credit access elaborated in\nthe concluding section.\nOnce in the credit regime, individuals can obtain credit, but its size is constrained by two\nadditional types of \fnancial frictions|limited commitment and asymmetric information. These\ndistort the allocation of capital and entrepreneurial talent in the economy, lowering aggregate\ntotal factor productivity (TFP). The \frst \fnancial friction is modeled as collateral constraints,\nwhich arise from the imperfect enforceability of contracts. Entrepreneurs have to post collateral in\norder to borrow. The amount/value of collateral is thus another determinant of \fnancial inclusion,\na\u000becting the amount of the credit available. The second \fnancial friction arises from asymmetric\ninformation between banks and borrowers. In this environment, interest rates charged on borrowing\nmust cover the cost of monitoring of highly-leveraged \frms. Because more productive and poorer\nagents are more likely to be highly leveraged, the ensuing higher intermediation cost is another\nsource of ine\u000eciency and \fnancial exclusion", "article_title": "DistiguishingFinancialConstraints", "full_section_title": "", "block_type": "text", "language": "en", "last_edit_date": "2024-01-01", "num_tokens": 276}
{"id": "DistiguishingFinancialConstraints_6", "content_string": ". As only highly leveraged \frm are monitored, \frms\nface di\u000berential costs of capital and may choose not to borrow even when credit is available.\nIn our model, greater \fnancial inclusion impacts GDP and inequality primarily through two\nchannels. First, it allows for a more e\u000ecient allocation of funds among entrepreneurs, thereby\nincreasing aggregate output. This occurs as funds are channeled to talented entrepreneurs, increasing\ntheir output disproportionately more than that of less-talented ones. Second, more e\u000ecient \fnancial\ncontracts limit waste from \fnancial frictions (e.g., the credit participation and monitoring costs)\nleading to higher GDP. If higher output is achieved through the reallocation of funds to more\ntalented entrepreneurs, who are already receiving a higher income than other agents, income\ninequality can rise. However, \fnancial inclusion through lower credit participation costs can also\ncrowd-in relatively untalented agents, resulting in a decrease in income inequality. This underlines\nthe trade-o\u000b between GDP and inequality.\nWe calibrate the model using data from the World Bank Enterprise Surveys and World Devel-\nopment Indicators. The Enterprise Survey is a \frm-level survey of a representative sample of \frms\n3in an economy. The surveys cover a broad range of business environment topics including access\nto \fnance, corruption, infrastructure, crime, competition, and performance measures", "article_title": "DistiguishingFinancialConstraints", "full_section_title": "", "block_type": "text", "language": "en", "last_edit_date": "2024-01-01", "num_tokens": 302}
{"id": "DistiguishingFinancialConstraints_7", "content_string": ". We jointly\nchoose the model's key parameters to match the simulated moments, such as the percent of \frms\nwith credit and the \frm employment distribution, as well as the economy-wide non-performing\nloans ratio, and interest rate spread. We calibrate the model separately for six developing countries\nat varying degrees of economic development: three low-income countries (Uganda in 2005, Kenya\nin 2006, and Mozambique in 2006), and three emerging market economies (Malaysia in 2006,\nPhilippines in 2007, and Egypt in 2007). Although \fnancial systems in emerging market economies\nare more developed than in low-income countries, this does not hold for every dimension of \fnancial\ninclusion. For example, the collateral requirement in the Philippines is 238.4% of the loan amount,\nwhich is higher than the requirement in Uganda, Kenya and Mozambique. Moreover, di\u000berent\ndimensions of \fnancial inclusion vary signi\fcantly even within countries at a similar stage of\neconomic development. For example, Kenya outperforms Uganda and Mozambique in terms of the\npercentage of \frms with access to credit, but the collateral requirement is more stringent.\nThe quantitative model developed in this paper enables us to examine the impact of various\n\fnancial inclusion policies on GDP, income inequality (as measured by the Gini coe\u000ecient) and\noverall welfare. The model simulations suggest that the impact of \fnancial inclusion policies\ndepends upon country-speci\fc characteristics", "article_title": "DistiguishingFinancialConstraints", "full_section_title": "", "block_type": "text", "language": "en", "last_edit_date": "2024-01-01", "num_tokens": 329}
{"id": "DistiguishingFinancialConstraints_8", "content_string": ". For example, Uganda's GDP is most responsive\nto a relaxation of borrowing/collateral constraints. This is because \frms in Uganda are severely\nconstrained by high collateral requirements, so that reducing intermediation costs only bene\fts a\nsmall number of highly-leveraged \frms. By contrast, high \fxed participation costs are a major\nobstacle to \fnancial inclusion in Malaysia. These results suggest that understanding the speci\fc\nfactors constraining \fnancial inclusion in an economy is critical for tailoring policy advice. The\nfocus of public policy should thus be on ameliorating the most pressing \fnancial frictions.\nThe model simulations also indicate that di\u000berent dimensions of \fnancial inclusion unambiguously\nincrease the economy's TFP as talented entrepreneurs, who desire to operate \frms at a larger scale,\nbene\ft disproportionately. However, they have a di\u000berential impact on GDP and inequality and\nthere are trade-o\u000bs. For example, a decline in participation costs reduces income inequality as\nentrepreneurs living in the savings regime obtain credit and workers receive higher wages. Relaxing\nborrowing constraints, on the other hand, can have an ambiguous impact on inequality, with\ninequality initially increasing and then declining. In other words, a Kuznets-type response can be\ngenerated. In fact, di\u000berent dimensions of \fnancial inclusion can result in di\u000berent distributional\nconsequences", "article_title": "DistiguishingFinancialConstraints", "full_section_title": "", "block_type": "text", "language": "en", "last_edit_date": "2024-01-01", "num_tokens": 314}
{"id": "DistiguishingFinancialConstraints_9", "content_string": ". In a partial equilibrium analysis, everyone can bene\ft from a more inclusive \fnancial\nsystem, albeit to varying degrees. However, in general equilibrium, the resulting changes in interest\nrates and wages can lead to losses for some agents. For example, the policy that is most e\u000bective\nin increasing access (reducing participation costs) bene\fts the poor and talented agents primarily,\nwhile wealthy agents lose due to higher interest rates and wages. By contrast, policies that target\n4\fnancial depth (relaxing borrowing constraints) bene\ft wealthy and talented agents but can impose\nlosses on wealthy but less-talented agents.\nWe also show that there exist rich interactions between di\u000berent dimensions of \fnancial inclusion.\nConducting two policies that target di\u000berent \fnancial frictions simultaneously can lead to a larger\nincrease in GDP for some range of parameter values. However, to the extent that these policies are\nsubstitutes, implementing one policy can reduce the e\u000bectiveness of other policies in boosting GDP.\nThe remainder of the paper is organized as follows. The next section provides a brief overview\nof the related literature. Section 3 sets out the structure of the model. Section 4 presents the data\nand the model calibration.

{"id": "DistiguishingFinancialConstraints_10", "content_string": ".\n2 Literature Review\nA growing theoretical literature has emphasized the aggregate and distributional impacts of \fnancial\nintermediation in models of occupational choice and \fnancial frictions. This theoretical framework\nis \frst introduced by Banerjee and Newman (1993) to capture the process of economic development.\nLloyd-Ellis and Bernhardt (2000) extend the model to explain income inequality and the existence\nof a Kuznets curve. Cagetti and Nardi (2006) build on the framework to show that the introduction\nof a bequest motive generates lifetime savings pro\fles more consistent with data. In these studies,\nimproved \fnancial intermediation leads to greater entry into entrepreneurship, higher productivity\nand investment, and a general equilibrium e\u000bect that increases wages. Moreover, the models suggest\nthat the distribution of wealth or the joint distribution of wealth and productivity is critical.\nA related literature has found sizable impacts of improved \fnancial intermediation on aggregate\nproductivity and income (Gine and Townsend, 2004; Jeong and Townsend, 2007, 2008; Amaral\nand Quintin, 2010; Buera, Kaboski and Shin, 2011; Greenwood, Sanchez and Wang, 2013). Buera,\nKaboski and Shin (2011) incorporate forward-looking agents in an occupational choice framework,\nshowing that \fnancial frictions account for a substantial part of the observed cross-country di\u000berences\nin output per worker and aggregate TFP", "article_title": "DistiguishingFinancialConstraints", "full_section_title": "", "block_type": "text", "language": "en", "last_edit_date": "2024-01-01", "num_tokens": 324}
{"id": "DistiguishingFinancialConstraints_11", "content_string": ". Moreover, Buera, Kaboski and Shin (2012) focus on the\ngeneral equilibrium e\u000bects of micro \fnance. They \fnd that the impact of scaling-up micro\fnance\non per-capita income is small, because of the ensuing redistribution of income from high-savers to\nlow-savers, but the vast majority of the population bene\fts from higher wages. Moll (2014) shows\nthat the impact of \fnancial frictions on GDP and TFP depends on the persistence of idiosyncratic\nshocks, and that the short-run e\u000bects of \fnancial frictions tend to be larger than their long-run\nimpacts.\nOur model builds on this occupational choice framework, but with novel features. We focus on\nseveral dimensions of \fnancial inclusion within an economy. Although these dimensions have typically\nbeen considered separately in the previous literature, our paper provides a uni\fed framework for\n5examining them individually as well as jointly. Our model features three types of \fnancial frictions:\n\fxed costs of credit entry, limited commitment, and asymmetric information. Unlike previous\nstudies, our model allows us to also uncover how di\u000berent frictions interact with each other. In this\nsense, our paper is related to studies in which multiple \fnancial frictions co-exist and are compared.\nClementi and Hopenhayn (2006) and Albuquerque and Hopenhayn (2004) argue that moral hazard\nand limited commitment have di\u000berent implications for \frm dynamics", "article_title": "DistiguishingFinancialConstraints", "full_section_title": "", "block_type": "text", "language": "en", "last_edit_date": "2024-01-01", "num_tokens": 337}

Abraham and Pavoni (2005)\nand Doepke and Townsend (2006) discuss how consumption allocations di\u000ber under moral hazard\nwith and without hidden savings versus full information. Martin and Taddei (2013) study the\nimplications of adverse selection on macroeconomic aggregates and contrast them with those under\nlimited commitment. Karaivanov and Townsend (2014) estimate the \fnancial/information regime\nin place for households (including those running businesses) in Thailand and \fnd that a moral\nhazard constrained \fnancial regime \fts the data best in urban areas, while a more limited savings\nregime is more applicable for rural areas. Similarly, Paulson, Townsend and Karaivanov (2006)\nargue that moral hazard best \fts the data in the more urban Central region of Thailand but not in\nthe more rural Northeast. Kinnan (2014) uses a di\u000berent metric based on the \frst-order conditions\ncharacterizing optimal insurance under moral hazard, limited commitment and hidden income\nto distinguish between these regimes in Thai data. Finally, Moll, Townsend and Zhorin (2014)\nuse a general equilibrium framework that encompasses di\u000berent types of frictions, and examines\nthe equilibrium interactions among various frictions.

And what is\nthe impact of alleviating these \fnancial frictions individually or jointly?\nOur paper is also related to a large empirical literature on the real e\u000bects of credit. The view\nthat \fnancial inclusion spurs economic growth is supported by empirical evidence (King and Levine,\n1993; Levine, 2005). Regression-based analyses at the aggregate level reveal a strong correlation\nbetween broad measures of \fnancial depth (such as M2 or credit to GDP) and economic growth.\nFor \frms, access to \fnance is positively associated with innovation, job creation, and growth (Beck,\nDemirg-Kunt and Maksimovic, 2005; Ayyagari, Demirgc-Kunt and Maksimovic, 2008). There is also\nevidence that aggregate \fnancial depth is positively associated with poverty reduction and income\ninequality (Beck, Demirg-Kunt and Levine, 2007; Clarke, Xu and fu Zou, 2006). Cross-sectional\nregression analysis, however, can be problematic as causality cannot easily be established, causal\nmechanisms are di\u000ecult to pin down, and policy evaluation is more challenging. Moreover, the\nimplicit assumptions of stationarity and linearity in regression analysis could be incorrect, even\nafter taking logs and including lags, if these variables lie on complex transitional growth paths\n(Townsend and Ueda, 2006)", "article_title": "DistiguishingFinancialConstraints", "full_section_title": "", "block_type": "text", "language": "en", "last_edit_date": "2024-01-01", "num_tokens": 333}
{"id": "DistiguishingFinancialConstraints_14", "content_string": ". The advantage of using a structural framework such as ours lies in\ncapturing salient features of the economy and the pertinent \fnancial sector frictions.\n6Our paper is also broadly related to the literature on misallocation (Hsieh and Klenow, 2009;\nCaselli and Gennaioli, 2013; Midrigan and Xu, 2014; Moll, 2014) and inequality (Davies, 1982;\nHuggett, 1996; Aghion and Bolton, 1997; Castaneda, Diaz-Gimenez and Rios-Rull, 2003; Nardi,\n2004). Our contribution is to show that policy options that target di\u000berent \fnancial sector frictions\nhave di\u000berent impacts on resource allocation and inequality. More importantly, even for the same\npolicy, the impacts on inequality can di\u000ber as these impacts are contingent on country-speci\fc\ncharacteristics.\n3 The Model\nThe economy is populated by a continuum of agents of measure one. Agents are heterogeneous in\nterms of initial wealth band talentz.\nEach agent lives for two periods.

Agents in the low-leverage region are not borrowing much\nin the sense that the face value of loan can be repaid even if production fails. Thus, banks do not\nmonitor them, and the lending interest rate is equal to the deposit interest rate, as shown in Figure\nIV. By contrast, agents in the high-leverage region default when production fails, in which case\nbanks monitor and seize the recovered undepreciated working capital and after-interest collateral.\nIn accordance with Proposition 3, the high-leverage region is to the left of the low-leverage region,\nimplying that entrepreneurs would prefer to leverage more when wealth is low to bene\ft from the\nhigh marginal return on capital.\nThe policy options we consider in section 5, move the lines in the occupation map (Figure V),\nand also alter the relative income received by di\u000berent agents.

In the next section, we analyze macroeconomic\nimplications of \fnancial inclusion and identify the role that country characteristics play in the\nprocess.\n5 Evaluation of Policy Options\nAs mentioned above, \fnancial inclusion is re\rected by three parameters in our model. The credit\nparticipation cost,  , directly measures the di\u000eculty of obtaining credit. A decrease in its value\ntherefore re\rects greater \fnancial access. The parameter \u0015in the borrowing constraint coincides\ndirectly with the maximum leverage ratio, an increase in which re\rects lower collateral requirements.\nFinally, a decrease in the cost of state veri\fcation, \u001f, indicates an increase in the \\e\u000eciency\" of\n\fnancial intermediation. It should be noted that the percent of \frms with credit in our model is\n22endogenous and is a\u000bected by all the three parameters.\nBecause \fnancial inclusion is multidimensional, it is di\u000ecult to identify precisely the meaning\nof these three parameters from an empirical standpoint. However, one can \fnd evidence of policies\nthat address one dimension or the other. For example, Assuncao, Mityakov and Townsend (2012)\nand Alem and Townsend (2013) \fnd that the distance to a bank branch matters for credit access,\nwhich suggests that policies that promote branch openings in rural, unbanked locations could\nhelp reduce the credit participation cost,", "article_title": "DistiguishingFinancialConstraints", "full_section_title": "", "block_type": "text", "language": "en", "last_edit_date": "2024-01-01", "num_tokens": 309}

Finally,\n\fnancial liberalization and the resultant competition between \fnancial institutions could accelerate\ninvestment in computerization, thereby improving intermediation e\u000eciency (as re\rected by a\ndecrease in \u001fin our model).

The transitional dynamics are also computable from the model. However, we only report the outcome of\nsimulations in steady states because focusing on the transitional dynamics could be misleading for at least two\nreasons: (1) the transition is rapid at the beginning but becomes slower when the economy is approaching the steady\nstate. This is inconsistent with reality, where the impact of \fnancial reforms happen gradually, or at least the\nimmediate impact is not signi\fcant; (2) the numerical error is large relative to that in the steady state, possibly\nleading to overshooting of some variables if parameters are adjusted a lot", "article_title": "DistiguishingFinancialConstraints", "full_section_title": "", "block_type": "text", "language": "en", "last_edit_date": "2024-01-01", "num_tokens": 312}

Relaxing the borrowing constraint allows all entrepreneurs to borrow more, but, on average,\nuntalented ones do not borrow as much because their smaller (maximum) business scale may have\nalready been achieved.

A higher intermediation cost restricts entrepreneurs from borrowing more as they want\nto keep a low leverage ratio to avoid being monitored. This dampens the GDP-boosting e\u000bect that\narises from a relaxation of the borrowing constraint. If the intermediation cost is too high, relaxing\nborrowing constraints would be futile as all entrepreneurs prefer to stay with a low leverage ratio\nto avoid paying the monitoring cost.\n[Figure 12 about here", "article_title": "DistiguishingFinancialConstraints", "full_section_title": "", "block_type": "text", "language": "en", "last_edit_date": "2024-01-01", "num_tokens": 315}

However, because their demand for capital is\nlow, the bene\ft from the lower cost of capital is smaller than the increased cost of labor wages.24\nAgents in the lower-right area lose because they operate \frms with a low leverage ratio (not being\nmonitored), hence they do not receive bene\fts from the lower intermediation cost but su\u000ber from\nthe increase in labor costs.\n23We expect this result to change if agents are in\fnitely lived and forward looking in the model, as talented agents\nwould have time to accumulate wealth and eventually mitigate their credit constraint.\n24According to the labor demand function in Proposition 1, the capital/labor ratio is increasing in wealth.

Therefore, the model is unable to capture one important\nway of coping with \fnancial frictions: self-\fnancing. Buera, Kaboski and Shin (2011) and Moll\n(2014) all emphasize that the e\u000bects of \fnancial frictions are ampli\fed if a self-\fnancing channel\nis precluded. As a result, it is expected that in the presence of forward looking agents and an\nendogenous savings rate, the impact of \fnancial inclusion on GDP could be smaller.\nIn appendix B, we extend the model with forward looking agents to address this concern. Solving\nthe forward-looking-agents model, however, requires substantially more computing power, which\nrestricts us from matching the employment distribution for each country. For this reason, we set\nthe productivity distribution tail parameter, \u0012, to 4.15 for all six countries, as in Buera and Shin\n(2013) calibrated using the U.S. employment distribution. The other parameters are calibrated to\nmatch the same set of moments as in the baseline model (see Table A.1). To obtain consistent\ncomparisons with the baseline model, we re-calibrate the other parameters in the baseline model\nfor each country under the parameter restriction, \u0012= 4:15 (see Table A.2).25\nThe results shown in Table A", "article_title": "DistiguishingFinancialConstraints", "full_section_title": "", "block_type": "text", "language": "en", "last_edit_date": "2024-01-01", "num_tokens": 323}

But the di\u000berence is not as large partly because in our\nmodel production fails with probability p, in which case entrepreneurs' wealth is wiped out. This\nconstrains the self-\fnancing channel. However, there are other di\u000berences. Notably, a reduction in\nintermediation costs has a much larger GDP and TFP boosting e\u000bect as compared to the baseline\nmodel.26One reason for this could be that entrepreneurs response to lower intermediation costs\nby saving more, which is not captured if the savings rate is constant.27The same most-binding-\nconstraint that constrains GDP are identi\fed for all six countries by the two models. In Uganda,\nKenya, Mozambique, and the Philippines, GDP increases more if borrowing constraints are relaxed,\nwhile in Malaysia and Egypt, GDP is most responsive to reduced participation costs. The prediction\non the change in income inequality is broadly consistent with the baseline model for reducing the\nparticipation cost and relaxing the borrowing constraint. However, the change in Gini coe\u000ecient\nhas a \ripped sign when the intermediation cost is lowered.\nWe prefer to retain our baseline overlapping generations framework as our primary speci\fcation", "article_title": "DistiguishingFinancialConstraints", "full_section_title": "", "block_type": "text", "language": "en", "last_edit_date": "2024-01-01", "num_tokens": 310}

However, according to the simulation results\npresented in Table A.3, the impact of parameter \u0012on the model-predicted change in GDP, TFP, and the Gini\ncoe\u000ecient is not as clear cut, depending on country-speci\fc characteristics.\n26This seems to be consistent with the results in Greenwood, Sanchez and Wang (2013), which is able to capture a\nwide range of GDP per worker by purely varying the intermediation costs.\n27This is con\frmed in the response of the credit access ratio. In the model with forward looking agents, agents\nsave to pay the credit participation cost as the monitoring cost decreases, which increases the credit access ratio\nsigni\fcantly. However, this is not happening in the baseline model's simulation.\n31First, the lemmas and propositions are clear in the baseline model and would not have closed-form\nexpressions in a more general forward-looking-agents model, due to the concavity of the value\nfunction. Second, computational complexity increases tremendously in a model with forward looking\nagents.28This precludes the possibility of matching the employment distribution in every country.29\nRecovery Rate The recovery rate \u0011is a commonly used modeling ingredient in the corporate\n\fnance literature (see Altman, 2008)", "article_title": "DistiguishingFinancialConstraints", "full_section_title": "", "block_type": "text", "language": "en", "last_edit_date": "2024-01-01", "num_tokens": 316}

Since the calibration does\nnot allow us to exactly identify the value of \u0011, we provide here a robustness check, to show that\nthe model's quantitative performance is not determined by its value. We calibrate the baseline\nmodel to match the same set of moments for all six countries, with the value of \u0011being set at\na lower value than the baseline calibration. Table A.4 presents the calibration results. All else\nbeing equal, a lower \u0011leads to a higher proportion of non-performing loans, which dictates a lower\nproduction failure rate (parameter p) and a higher intermediation cost (parameter \u001f) if the moments\nof non-performing loans ratio and interest rate spread are matched. However, the quantitative\nresults (Table A.5) are mostly in line with the baseline model.\nMonitoring Cost We calibrate the intermediation cost (parameter \u001f) by matching the interest\nrate spread, which is an ex-ante margin that banks charge as compensation for risks. To address the\nconcern that the interest rate spread may not be capturing the costs of operating banks, we provide\nan alternative calibration. We use an ex-post margin, the bank overhead costs to total assets ratio\nobtained from World Bank Global Financial Development Database (GFDD) and calibrate the\nintermediation cost to match its average value over the period 2000 { 2011", "article_title": "DistiguishingFinancialConstraints", "full_section_title": "", "block_type": "text", "language": "en", "last_edit_date": "2024-01-01", "num_tokens": 316}

As a result, the\nimpact of reducing the intermediation cost on GDP is larger. However, the impact of reducing the\nparticipation cost and relaxing the borrowing constraint are relatively unchanged. Thus, the most\nbinding \fnancial constraint in each country identi\fed in the baseline model's prediction remains\n28For a computer with i7-4700MQ CPU (2.40GHz), it takes 20 minutes to compute the steady-state of the baseline\nmodel using matlab (2014a). However, for the model with forward looking agents, it takes more than 24 hours if\nreasonable accuracy level is required. To promote the computation speed, we code the value function iteration and\nwealth distribution iteration parts of the program in C++ (VS studio 2014) and use matlab to call these scripts. At\nthe same time, we use a 20-core server to parallel the computation of heterogeneity. This reduces the computation\ntime of the steady-state to 40 minutes. So more complicated dynamics are within reach, but require more hardware\nand coding, which limits their wide applicability and are still two times slower.\n29As noted before, the calibration for the forward looking model is done by selecting parameter \u0012from the literature,\nwhich is calibrated using the U.S. employment distribution, not the distribution of each country", "article_title": "DistiguishingFinancialConstraints", "full_section_title": "", "block_type": "text", "language": "en", "last_edit_date": "2024-01-01", "num_tokens": 317}

Similar approaches\nare also seen from several other quantitative papers with forward looking heterogeneous agents (e.g. Buera, Kaboski\nand Shin, 2011; Buera and Shin, 2013; Greenwood, Sanchez and Wang, 2013).\n30Greenwood, Sanchez and Wang (2013, Figure 6) show that this variable re\rects the monitoring e\u000eciency in a\ncross-country analysis.\n32valid.\n7 Conclusion\nWe develop a tractable micro-founded general equilibrium model with heterogeneous agents to\nanalyze the implications of \fnancial inclusion policies on GDP and inequality in developing countries.\nIn particular, we focus on three speci\fc dimensions of greater \fnancial inclusion: access (as measured\nby the size of credit participation costs), depth (as measured by the size of collateral constraints\nresulting from limited commitment), and intermediation e\u000eciency (as measured by the size of\ninterest rate spreads, re\recting default risk and asymmetric information).\nUsing analytical and numerical methods, we calibrate the model for six low-income and emerging\nmarket countries|Uganda, Kenya, Mozambique, Malaysia, the Philippines, and Egypt. While our\nsimulation results are intended to be illustrative, they indicate that relaxing various \fnancial sector\nfrictions may a\u000bect GDP and inequality in di\u000berent ways.

The model simulations suggest that\nthe impact of \fnancial inclusion policies do depend greatly upon country-speci\fc characteristics.\nThus understanding the speci\fc constraints generating the lack of \fnancial inclusion in an economy\nis critical for tailoring policy recommendations. Moreover, the model simulations indicate that\ndi\u000berent dimensions of \fnancial inclusion have a di\u000berential impact on GDP and inequality and\nthat there are trade-o\u000bs.

Again, we\nassume workers get paid only when production is successful. Therefore, each worker earns a wage\nwith probability 1 \u0000p.\nAll agents can make a deposit in a \fnancial institution so as to transfer wealth across periods.\nHowever, agents need to pay a \fxed credit participation cost,  , to borrow from the bank.

Therefore, agent who obtained credit in\nperiodt, still has to pay  in periodt+ 1 if she wants to borrow.\nTo simplify the problem (and also to be consistent with our myopic-agent model), we assume\nthat agent chooses occupation, credit participation, and capital and labor input to maximize the\nexpected end-of-period wealth (or expected income). Then, the agent chooses consumption and\nsavings to maximizes utility. Notice that this allows us to solve the problem in two separate\nsteps. In the \frst step, we solve a static problem to obtain the optimal occupation choice, credit\nparticipation, capital and labor inputs conditional on the beginning-of-period wealth and talent. In\nthe second step, we solve a dynamic problem to obtain optimal consumption and savings. Thus\nthe only di\u000berence to the baseline myopic agent model is that we endogenize the consumption and\nsavings decision instead of using a constant savings rate.\nSince the \frst part of the problem is solved exactly in the same way as in the baseline myopic\nagent model, below we only formulate the endogenous consumption/savings decision, while taking\nthe occupation choice, credit participation, capital and labor input as given.\nLetV(b;z;t ) be the agent's value function at the beginning of the period t.

{"id": "FinancialInclusionEvidenceBrazil_3", "content_string": ".edu1 Introduction\nThe presence of bank branches at fine geographical levels has long been considered a key\ndeterminant of financial inclusion and an important driver of economic growth. Bank branch\nproximity mitigates the transaction costs of mobilizing savings from many agents, which\ncan increase the capital available to entrepreneurs. Branch proximity also lowers the cost to\nbanks of screening and monitoring entrepreneurs, and of providing access to liquidity services.\nHowever, setting up bank branches is not only costly but also risky, as demand for deposits\nand loans can only be observed after the creation of the branch, which can lead to an under-\nprovision of financial services.\nFor this reason, policymakers across the world have sought to promote financial inclu-\nsion by implementing large-scale reforms to expand the physical networks of bank branches.1\nThe popularity of these financial inclusion policies raises multiple questions: do they suc-\nceed in promoting financial and economic development and, if so, how? And what are the\ndistributional consequences of such policies?\nIn this paper, we trace out the dynamic effects on both economic development and wage\ninequality of a government program that improved access to mainstream financial services.\nWe use the introduction of the \u201cBanks for All\u201d program ( \u201cBanco para Todos\u201d ) by the Brazil-\nian federal government in 2004, which explicitly targeted underbanked cities by introducing\nbranches of government-owned banks", "article_title": "FinancialInclusionEvidenceBrazil", "full_section_title": "", "block_type": "text", "language": "en", "last_edit_date": "2024-01-01", "num_tokens": 284}

This policy constitutes a unique natural experiment\nfeaturing a large, plausibly exogenous shock to financial access and capital deepening at the\nlevel of entire labor markets.\nOur empirical analysis combines Brazilian administrative employer-employee data cover-\ning the universe of formal employees in Brazil with detailed bank branch balance sheets from\n2000\u20132014. In a difference-in-differences research design, we compare the evolution of various\noutcomes in cities benefiting from this policy (those with no government-owned banks prior\nto the reform) relative to unaffected cities. We use a parsimonious matching procedure to\nselect control cities for each treated city, where we match on the pre-reform population quin-\ntile and Gini growth, and we estimate the effect of financial development on employment,\nentrepreneurship, firm growth, average wage, and wage inequality.\nOur identification strategy exploits ex-ante differences in the presence of government-\nowned banks across cities, but it does notrequire the initial presence of government-owned\nbanks to be random. It only requires that outcomes of treated and control cities would\nhave evolved similarly absent the reform. While, by definition, this identifying assumption is\nuntestable, we provide a battery of tests that are supportive of it, which we discuss in detail\n1. Examples include China in the 1970s, India in the 1980s, Thailand in the 1980s and 1990s.\n2after summarizing our results", "article_title": "FinancialInclusionEvidenceBrazil", "full_section_title": "", "block_type": "text", "language": "en", "last_edit_date": "2024-01-01", "num_tokens": 299}

Specifically, we: (i) show evidence of pre-reform parallel trends\nfor our key city-level outcomes, (ii) show that our matching procedure leads to covariate\nbalance across a wide array of city-level characteristics not targeted by the matching, (iii)\ndirectly control for city characteristics pre-reform, (iv) employ a city-by-industry difference-\nin-differences estimator to control for sector-specific shocks that could differentially impact\ncities exposed to the policy. The stability of point estimates across the different strategies\nimplies our results cannot be explained by differential exposure to aggregate or city-specific\nshocks.\nWe start by showing that the reform leads to financial inclusion and financial development.\nAfter 2004, the number of bank branches increases in treated cities, leading to an inflow of\nlocal deposits and an increase in credit supply of similar magnitude. The similar expansion\nin local deposits and credit points to an increase in the amount of capital available to local\nfirms, rather than a reallocation of capital to treated cities from other regions of the country.2\nThe increases in total bank branches, deposits, and credit do not mean revert but instead\nshift to a new, higher steady state. This implies better access to external funding and liq-\nuidity services, both of which can foster economic development", "article_title": "FinancialInclusionEvidenceBrazil", "full_section_title": "", "block_type": "text", "language": "en", "last_edit_date": "2024-01-01", "num_tokens": 276}

The\nabsence of an effect on private credit can be seen as a placebo test, showing that our results\nare not driven by differential exposure of treated cities to economy-wide shocks experienced\nby Brazil during this period.\nOur second set of results is about the average effect of the reform on economic development.\nWe show that the reform leads to an increase in employment by 10%, mostly driven by an\nexpansion of smaller firms. Increased labor demand pushes up the average wage per worker\nby 4.1%. Looking at firm dynamics, we find that the reform-induced bank branch expansion\nfosters entrepreneurship, as the number of firms increases by roughly 10%. This increase masks\nan even higher acceleration of underlying firm dynamism, as both firm entry and firm exit rate\nincrease. While these results only reflect patterns in the formal sector, entrepreneurial activity\nand firm growth in the formal sector are of first-order importance for economic development,\nas the transition from subsistence to transformational entrepreneurs and the integration of\nworkers in the formal sector foster economic growth (e.g., Dix-Carneiro, Goldberg, Meghir,\nand Ulyssea, 2021)", "article_title": "FinancialInclusionEvidenceBrazil", "full_section_title": "", "block_type": "text", "language": "en", "last_edit_date": "2024-01-01", "num_tokens": 277}

Nonetheless, we show in robustness checks that our results are not driven\nby firms and workers moving from the informal sector to the formal sector.\n2. As additional evidence that capital is not flowing from control cities to treated cities, we show that credit\ngrowth does not slow down in control cities around the time of the reform.\n3. See Yang and Xu (2022) for an example of how access to liquidity services thanks to bank branch\nexpansion promoted development in 19th-century US.\n3The richness of our data allows us to examine the mechanisms that link financial in-\nclusion and economic development. Financial inclusion could foster growth by increasing\naggregate demand by improving households\u2019 access to credit and by allowing households to\nbetter smooth their consumption, thereby reducing the need for precautionary saving. We\nrule out this local demand channel as the main driver of our results by showing that employ-\nment growth is mostly driven by firms in the tradable sector, which are by definition less\ndependent on local demand.\nSo why would financial inclusion promote entrepreneurship and firm growth? We show\nthat the policy-induced increase in financial inclusion works by reducing the physical distance\nbetween banks and entrepreneurs", "article_title": "FinancialInclusionEvidenceBrazil", "full_section_title": "", "block_type": "text", "language": "en", "last_edit_date": "2024-01-01", "num_tokens": 238}
{"id": "FinancialInclusionEvidenceBrazil_8", "content_string": ". Indeed, the positive effect of the reform increases propor-\ntionally with the distance between treated cities and the closest city with a bank branch prior\nto the reform and is larger for smaller firms, which likely face bigger informational frictions.\nThese gains are the same whether the nearest bank is private or public, suggesting that our\nresults are not driven by particulars of how public banks operate (e.g., by access to subsidized\nor politically-motivated loans). Instead, these results are consistent with the distance to bank\nbranches affecting access to liquidity, and with models in which the distance between borrow-\ners and lenders affects the cost of credit either because it reduces screening and monitoring\ncosts (e.g., Greenwood and Jovanovic, 1990; Townsend and Ueda, 2006), in particular when\nsoft information is prevalent (e.g., Petersen and Rajan, 1994,; Hombert and Matray, 2017).\nOur third set of results is about the distributional effects of the reform. We find that the\npolicy leads to a sizable increase in wage inequality within treated cities. This is explained\nby the fact that, although all workers are better off after the reform, the magnitude of wage\ngains rises monotonically with the position of workers in the wage distribution", "article_title": "FinancialInclusionEvidenceBrazil", "full_section_title": "", "block_type": "text", "language": "en", "last_edit_date": "2024-01-01", "num_tokens": 268}
{"id": "FinancialInclusionEvidenceBrazil_9", "content_string": ". Our detailed\npanel data of workers allow us to show that this increase is not driven by a change in the\nsample composition, but instead reflects an increase in wages holding fixed individuals\u2019 sex,\nage, education, occupation, and sectoral specialization. We also show that our results are\nquantitatively unchanged when we restrict our sample to workers that we observe throughout\nthe sample period and to firms already in the data prior to the reform. These sample restric-\ntions allow us to show that our results are not driven by workers entering the formal sector\nafter the reform or more general changes in the sample composition of worker characteristics.\nWe then explore two explanations that can account for the rise in inequality. First, fi-\nnancial development could increase the relative demand for skilled labor, either because of a\nlarge fixed component to the cost of skilled labor (e.g., Benmelech, Bergman, and Seru, 2021;\nSchoefer, 2021) or because the relative productivity of skilled workers increases with financial\ndevelopment (Fonseca and Doornik, 2021). Models that assume that financial development\nincreases the relative productivity of skilled workers or loosens constraints on the demand\n4for skilled workers generally predict that the equilibrium skill mix should change, with firms\nincreasing the share of skilled workers in their workforce", "article_title": "FinancialInclusionEvidenceBrazil", "full_section_title": "", "block_type": "text", "language": "en", "last_edit_date": "2024-01-01", "num_tokens": 279}
{"id": "FinancialInclusionEvidenceBrazil_10", "content_string": ". However, when looking at the effect\nof the policy on the average skill composition of firms, we find that the share of skilled workers\ndoes not increase in treated cities.\nInstead, we find support for another explanation: skills are scarce, especially in developing\ncountries, which means that the supply of skilled workers is more inelastic than that of\nunskilled workers in the short run. We show that cities in our setting are characterized by\nhigh internal migration costs and that the reform does not induce worker migration to treated\ncities. This lack of inter-city mobility implies that an increase in labor demand can only be\nserved by the supply of local workers. Consistent with skilled workers being in short supply,\nwe find that all the increase in inequality is concentrated in cities where a lower fraction of\nthe population is educated prior to the reform.\nWe consider a wide range of robustness checks. We start by showing that our results\nare quantitatively unchanged when we use different matching procedures. We then discuss\nthreats to identification. Our strategy faces two key threats. First, even in the absence of\npre-trends, treated cities may be ex-ante different in ways that differentially expose them to\naggregate shocks post-2004. That would be the case if, for instance, treated cities are ex-\nante more exposed to the commodity boom of the mid-2000s", "article_title": "FinancialInclusionEvidenceBrazil", "full_section_title": "", "block_type": "text", "language": "en", "last_edit_date": "2024-01-01", "num_tokens": 283}
{"id": "FinancialInclusionEvidenceBrazil_11", "content_string": ". Second, our policy might have\ncoincided with shocks that specifically affected treated cities, such as idiosyncratic shocks to\nbanks entering treated cities or a targeted expansion of welfare programs.\nWe address the threat produced by ex-ante differences in three ways. (i) We show that\nour matched treatment and control groups are similar over a rich array of city characteristics\nthat were not included in the matching process, including exposure to the commodity sector,\nskilled employment, political affiliation, size of the informal sector, or the co-movement of\nlocal GDP with aggregate fluctuations. While common support in levels is not required for\ndifferences-in-differences designs, such similarity makes the common-trend assumption more\nplausible, as these similarities in the level of characteristics make it less likely that they reacted\ndifferently to broader macroeconomic shocks post-2004.\nIn addition, (ii) we show that our results are quantitatively unchanged after directly con-\ntrolling for a wide range of pre-reform controls interacted with year fixed effects. Estimating\nall possible combinations of pre-reform controls across the hundreds of different specifica-\ntions yields very similar point estimates. Finally (iii), we exploit the granularity of our\ndata to build a city-by-industry difference-in-differences estimator. This allows us to include\nindustry-by-year fixed effects and non-parametrically control for any unobserved time-varying\nsector-specific shocks (e.g", "article_title": "FinancialInclusionEvidenceBrazil", "full_section_title": "", "block_type": "text", "language": "en", "last_edit_date": "2024-01-01", "num_tokens": 302}
{"id": "FinancialInclusionEvidenceBrazil_12", "content_string": ".g., commodity booms or trade shocks). Our coefficients of interest\nare estimated in this case by comparing the same sector across treated and control cities,\n5and therefore this strategy does not require that treated and control cities are similarly ex-\nposed to sector-specific shocks. We show that point estimates at the city-industry level are\nquantitatively similar to city-level estimates.\nOur setting also addresses a wide array of potential ex-post treated-specific shocks because,\nby construction, control cities already have a government-owned bank. Therefore, any shocks\nspecific to government-owned banks (such as an overall increase in lending by public banks)\nwill affect both treated and control cities at the same time and will be absorbed by our\ndifference-in-differences specification. This design also addresses the possibility that welfare\nprogram expansions might differentially benefit treated cities, since some of the largest welfare\nprograms are distributed by one of the public banks already present in control cities (including\nthe largest at the time, Bolsa Fam\u00b4 \u0131lia ). Therefore, an expansion of these programs would also\naffect both treated and control cities. In additional robustness tests, we show that results\nare robust to including state-by-year, which controls for state-level shocks such as differences\nin state-administered welfare programs", "article_title": "FinancialInclusionEvidenceBrazil", "full_section_title": "", "block_type": "text", "language": "en", "last_edit_date": "2024-01-01", "num_tokens": 259}
{"id": "FinancialInclusionEvidenceBrazil_13", "content_string": ". At the municipality level, our effects are unchanged\nwhen we compare treated and control cities with the same political affiliation or directly\ncontrol for the observed changes in expenditures.\nWe end the paper by discussing how our reduced-form identified coefficients can provide\nuseful causal moments for the macro-finance development literature and speak to potentially\nimportant frictions or sources of heterogeneity that future models could incorporate. Our\npaper shows the importance of explicitly linking distance to the nearest bank to the cost and\navailability of credit as in the structural model of Ji, Teng, and Townsend (2023). We provide\ncausal estimates of how changes in distance can affect credit supply and savings in interest-\nbearing products, as well as their impact on employment, firm growth, and firm entry. We\nalso provide moments linking changes in the supply of credit and real outcomes, which relate\nto key parameters in macro-development models in which a reduced-form collateral constraint\naffects economic growth. The considerably larger effects we find for treated cities in banking\ndeserts point toward the existence of a non-linearity around very low levels of external finance,\nsomething that is usually not explicitly modeled and could help to reconcile different results\nin the literature", "article_title": "FinancialInclusionEvidenceBrazil", "full_section_title": "", "block_type": "text", "language": "en", "last_edit_date": "2024-01-01", "num_tokens": 244}

The closest one is on the\nrole of financial inclusion on financial intermediation costs and economic development, which\nplays a central role in macro-development models, but for which we have limited causally\n6estimates elasticities that can be tightly linked with model parameters.4\nOur setting allows us to better understand why financial inclusion fosters economic growth\nand provide new insights on the distributional effects of such policies. First, our high-quality\nadministrative data allow us to study many new margins through which financial inclusion\npolicies can foster development. Because we can observe the universe of formal economic\nactivity and track workers and firms over time, we can study a host of new outcomes: the\nprocess of creative destruction (firm entry and exit rate), the evolution of firm size distribution\nand the differential benefit for small vs. large firms measured pre-reform, as well as the\nevolution of sectoral composition (and in particular the relative growth of tradable vs. non-\ntradable sectors)", "article_title": "FinancialInclusionEvidenceBrazil", "full_section_title": "", "block_type": "text", "language": "en", "last_edit_date": "2024-01-01", "num_tokens": 256}

Because we observe the universe of workers and can track them over time,\nwe can also shed light on the evolution of the skill premium and wage inequality, accounting\nfor changes in sample composition, and the interaction between financial inclusion policies\nand constraints on the accumulation of human capital.\nThe literature on the effect of bank branch presence has so far mostly focused on developed\neconomies and studied financial outcomes such as credit or wealth accumulation. The litera-\nture on developing countries has mostly focused on the introduction of specific bank branches\nin localized markets and used short-run cross-sectional survey data to study real outcomes\nand find small, short-lived positive effects or even negative effects.5By contrast, our ad-\nministrative panel data allow us to track the long-run effect of the policy on the full causal\nchain linking financial inclusion to financial development (credit supply, access to liquidity\nservices); real outcomes (employment, sectoral growth, average wages, entry and exit rates\nof firms, firm size distribution) and the distributional consequences of this financial-inclusion\ndriven economic growth.\nSecond, the policy-driven expansion of bank branches happens through profitable, publicly\nowned commercial banks rather than development-focused state banks with specific sectoral\nand poverty reduction mandates as in the Indian experiment (Burgess and Pande, 2005; Cole,\n2009)", "article_title": "FinancialInclusionEvidenceBrazil", "full_section_title": "", "block_type": "text", "language": "en", "last_edit_date": "2024-01-01", "num_tokens": 281}

More generally,\nmost of the literature on developing countries has used randomized controlled trial and shocks to specific banks\n7This level of analysis coupled with data on the universe of bank branch networks in Brazil\nallows us to provide the first causal estimate of the role of distance to financial services, a\nkey parameter in macro-development models that analyze the role of banks, and to highlight\nthat financial inclusion is not a dichotomous concept but should instead be thought of as\ncontinuous.\nTaken together, our results have several policy implications. First, financial inclusion poli-\ncies can generate large effects on economic development, even while banks operate profitable\nbranches. Second, these policies can have large distributive effects, in particular as they in-\nteract with constraints on human capital accumulation. Third, the initial distance to existing\nbank branches matters for the expected gains in terms of economic development.

This branch expansion fosters the\nmobilization and pooling of local savings to start a virtuous circle between increased deposits,\nhigher credit, and economic development, originating from within the city as the distance\nbetween depositors, lenders, and borrowers is reduced. Therefore, our results imply that how\ncredit is distributed across places can matter as much as how much credit is distributed.\nThird, we contribute to the literature that studies the effect of financial development on\nwage inequality. Theoretical work in this literature focuses mostly on wealth inequality or total\nwith a focus on directly affected bank clients.

This bank provides subsidized loans\nto targeted sectors or even \u201cgrants,\u201d in the form of loans that are often not reimbursed. Two\nthings are important to highlight about BNDES.

Second, this bank, as well as state-controlled banks, was not\npart of the policy and not involved in the branch expansion we study, and its lending was not\nspecifically targeted at treated or control cities. Therefore, in the rest of the paper, we use\nthe term \u201cpublic banks\u201d to refer to federally-owned banks, which excludes BNDES.\nPublic banks differ from private banks in some dimensions, such as in having a legal\nmandate to provide earmarked credit.13However in practice, public banks are similar to\nprivate banks in their lending practices and the sectors to which they lend. For instance, public\nand private banks have similar portfolio compositions across credit products and borrowers,\ncharge similar interest rates and face similar delinquency rates (Coelho, Mello, and Rezende,\n13. There are also incentives for private banks to provide earmarked credit and, in fact, nearly 40% of\noutstanding indirect earmarked loans to firms in 2016 were originated by private banks (Ornelas, Pedraza,\nRuiz-Ortega, and Silva, 2021).\n102013)", "article_title": "FinancialInclusionEvidenceBrazil", "full_section_title": "", "block_type": "text", "language": "en", "last_edit_date": "2024-01-01", "num_tokens": 320}

As we show in Figure 2, there are no significant differences between branches of\npublic and private banks across a wide range of covariates, including measures of lending,\nprofitability, loan performance, and size.\n2.1.2 The Banks for All program\nBanks for All (Banco para Todos ) was a federal government program announced in 2004\nas part of the government\u2019s 2004\u20132007 multi-year plan ( Plano Plurianual ).

Ac-\ncording to an evaluation of the program by the federal government, public banks opened\n7.8 million accounts and banked 1.46 million low-income, previously unbanked individuals\nbetween 2004\u20132007 (Minist\u00b4 erio da Fazenda, 2007).15In Section 4, we formally show that\ncities without public bank branches prior to 2004 saw a sharp increase in credit and deposits\nfollowing the introduction of the program.\nBanking correspondents. In order to reach unbanked households, the program also relied\non correspondent banking outlets. These arrangements consist of banks hiring commercial\nentities\u2014typically lottery retailers, post offices, pharmacies, and other retailers\u2014to serve\nas distribution outlets for financial services. Since 2003, financial services offered by corre-\nspondents include the opening of accounts, deposits and withdrawals, payments, and loan\n14. Between 2004 and 2014 (the end of our sample period), 1,262 new bank branches were open in cities\neligible to the reform.\n15.

While this identification strategy does not require that treated\nand control cities be similar in levels prior to the reform, any such similarity makes the\ncommon-trend assumption more plausible.\nThis strategy raises a natural challenge: the average treated city in Brazil does not look\nlike the average untreated city. Since the reform targeted unbanked cities, these tended to\nbe smaller and less developed, and it is possible that they evolved and grew in different ways\nafter the reform relative to other untreated cities for reasons not directly tied to the reform.\nFor instance, they could have disproportionally benefited from the period of sustained growth,\n17.

But whether or not a\ngovernment bank branch opens in these a priori treated cities after the policy is adopted (i.e.,\nwhether the assigned unit takes the treatment) is potentially endogenous to their economic\noutcomes.21\n20. This is because the exogeneity of the assignment does not bear on the exogeneity of the receipt of\ntreatment if the receipt of treatment is different from the assignment to treatment (e.g., Athey and Imbens,\n2017).\n21.

Our identification\nstrategy faces two main threats: (i) Even if treated and control cities are perfectly similar\nex-ante, unobserved ex-post shocks might specifically affect the cities that are treated by our\nfinancial inclusion policy", "article_title": "FinancialInclusionEvidenceBrazil", "full_section_title": "", "block_type": "text", "language": "en", "last_edit_date": "2024-01-01", "num_tokens": 285}

(ii) Despite the use of a matching procedure, the variable we use\nto sort cities into treatment and control groups\u2014the presence of a government-controlled\nbank\u2014might still be correlated with other city-level characteristics that make treated units\nmore sensitive to aggregate shocks post 2004. We discuss how we address both of these\nconcerns below.\n(i) Treated-specific ex-post shocks. Even with perfect ex-ante covariate balance between\ntreated and control cities, the estimated effect of promoting financial inclusion on city-level\noutcomes could be biased if this policy correlates with other unobserved shocks that specifi-\ncally affect cities that received the treatment. This is a concern in a setting where no city has\na bank and identification is achieved by bank entry in some cities and not others. However, it\nis important to emphasize that our setting is conceptually different. By construction, public\nbanks are present in all control cities prior to the reform. Therefore, any bank-specific shock\nafter 2004 will affect both treated and control cities.\nThis setting therefore directly addresses two standard concerns about empirical designs\nfeaturing bank entry", "article_title": "FinancialInclusionEvidenceBrazil", "full_section_title": "", "block_type": "text", "language": "en", "last_edit_date": "2024-01-01", "num_tokens": 233}

First, if public banks experience idiosyncratic shocks that affect their\ncredit supply after 2004 (either due to shocks to their cost of funding or because they face\npolitical pressure to extend credit), both treated and control cities will benefit from a credit\nexpansion, and our coefficient of interest will not be biased.22\nSecond, potential correlations between financial inclusion policies and the expansion of\nother social welfare programs after 2004 are also addressed due to a specificity of the Brazil-\nian institutional context. Most of the large-scale welfare programs, and in particular Bolsa\nFam\u00b4 \u0131lia, are distributed via public banks. Therefore, all cities (including cities in the control\ngroup) would benefit from the creation or expansion of such programs. We also conduct more\ndetailed tests about this specific concern in Section 7.2and find no evidence that it biases\nour results.\n(ii) Covariate balance and ex-ante differences. The second main concern is that ex-ante\ndifferences lead treated cities to respond differentially to aggregate shocks.\nWe address this problem in four ways. First, as we show in Figure 3, using a parsimo-\nnious matching estimator allows us to obtain covariate balance across a wide range of proxies\nfor exposure to commodity-driven aggregate growth, economic integration of the city, and\n22. To be precise, the coefficient is not biased under the assumption that this bank-specific shock affects\nall branches of the bank in the same way", "article_title": "FinancialInclusionEvidenceBrazil", "full_section_title": "", "block_type": "text", "language": "en", "last_edit_date": "2024-01-01", "num_tokens": 307}

This would not be the case if this bank shock affects the bank\u2019s\nbranches differentially, for instance, due to age differences across branches.\n19exposure to welfare programs promoted by left-leaning governments. Second, we show that\ntreated and control cities were on a similar trend before the reform for a host of outcomes\n(credit, employment, number of firms, inequalities) in Sections 4,5, and 6. The parallel-trends\npre-reform indicate that any remaining unobserved differences that could drive the estimated\neffects would need to have not mattered before 2004 and only mattered afterward.\nThird, we directly control for a collection of additional city-level characteristics. We show\nin Appendix Tables A4andA5that point estimates are very stable to the inclusion of controls\nsuch as GDP per capita, employment in the commodity sector, skilled employment, political\naffiliation of the mayor, trade, distance to the state capital, and the co-movement of local GDP\nwith aggregate fluctuations, as well as to all the different combinations of such controls.23\nFinally, we exploit the granularity of our data and adapt equation (1) into a D-i-D estima-\ntor at the city-by-industry level, which allows us to relax the assumptions needed to identify\nthe effect of the reform", "article_title": "FinancialInclusionEvidenceBrazil", "full_section_title": "", "block_type": "text", "language": "en", "last_edit_date": "2024-01-01", "num_tokens": 270}

Following the reform, we find a continuous increase in Gini,\nimplying an increase in wage inequality. The magnitude is substantial, with treated cities\nhaving a Gini index that is two points higher ten years after the reform relative to control\n32cities, which represents an increase of 7% relative to the pre-reform mean.\nWhile this result shows that higher financial development leads to higher inequality, it\ndoes not tell us why the Gini is increasing in treated cities.\nWe therefore unpack the evolution of Gini by computing the average wage for each quartile\nof the city wage distribution to better understand the source of the overall change in inequality.\nTo do so, we estimate the distribution of wage within each city-year cell, split the sample into\nquartiles, and take the mean wage in each cell.\nFigure 8b reports the evolution of each wage quartile", "article_title": "FinancialInclusionEvidenceBrazil", "full_section_title": "", "block_type": "text", "language": "en", "last_edit_date": "2024-01-01", "num_tokens": 319}

First, financial development might lead to better employer-employee matching. This\ncould happen either because looser financial constraints on individuals allow them to search\nlonger and to find a better job match, or because less severe financial frictions can allow\nproductive firms to front-load wages and attract more productive workers, resulting in a\nreduction in labor misallocation and higher wages at the top of the distribution", "article_title": "FinancialInclusionEvidenceBrazil", "full_section_title": "", "block_type": "text", "language": "en", "last_edit_date": "2024-01-01", "num_tokens": 393}

Financial frictions can directly impact labor demand if there is a mis-\nmatch between payments to labor and the generation of cash-flows or if labor has a fixed-cost\ncomponent due to hiring and firing costs (Schoefer, 2021; Benmelech, Bergman, and Seru,\n2021). Since skilled workers require higher wages and are arguably more expensive to recruit\nand train, financial frictions disproportionately constrain the demand for skilled labor and,\nwhen lessened by the reform, lead to an increase in the demand for skilled labor relative to\nunskilled labor.\nAlternatively, if capital and skilled labor are relative complements, looser financial con-\nstraints can increase capital investment and, consequently, increase the marginal productivity\nof skilled workers relative to unskilled workers, also leading to an increase in the relative\ndemand for skilled workers (Fonseca and Doornik, 2021). A testable implication of either ver-\nsion of the skilled labor demand hypothesis is that, as the relative demand for skilled workers\n35rises, both the relative price and the relative quantity of skilled workers should rise, leading\nto an increase in the skill premium andin the share of skilled workers in treated cities.\nThird, labor demand might go up uniformly across the skill distribution, but the supply\nof unskilled workers could be more elastic than the supply of skilled workers", "article_title": "FinancialInclusionEvidenceBrazil", "full_section_title": "", "block_type": "text", "language": "en", "last_edit_date": "2024-01-01", "num_tokens": 306}

In this case, the\nskill composition of firms remains stable, but the price of skilled workers goes up, particularly\nso in cities facing higher shortages of skilled workers.\nBetter matching. To test if the matching between workers and firms improves following\nthe reform, we build on Eeckhout and Kircher (2011) and Lopes de Melo (2018), which give\na structural interpretation to the firm fixed effects in Abowd, Kramarz, and Margolis (1999)\nregressions and show that better matching should reduce the dispersion of worker ability\nwithin the firm.32\nWe proxy for worker type with the average log wage over all job spells. We compute\nthe standard deviation of worker types at the firm-year level, residualize the variable from\nfirm fixed effects to account for changes in industry-city composition over time, and take the\nmean of the residualized dispersion in worker types at the 2-digit-industry-by-city level for\neach year. We can then test whether the average dispersion declines as a consequence of the\nreform.33\nTable 7 shows results of this exercise. Across all specifications, we find that if anything,\nthe within-firm dispersion in worker type increases (by a small amount relative to the pre-\nreform average of 0.34). This is the opposite of what we would expect from an improvement\nin employer-employee matching, which should lead to lower within-firm dispersion in worker\ntypes.\nIncrease in demand for skilled workers", "article_title": "FinancialInclusionEvidenceBrazil", "full_section_title": "", "block_type": "text", "language": "en", "last_edit_date": "2024-01-01", "num_tokens": 312}

To test whether a change in the relative demand\nfor skilled workers can explain the rise in wage inequality, we need an ex-ante, time-invariant\ndefinition of skill. We leverage the fact that the Brazilian matched employer-employee data\nallow us to observe education and classify workers as skilled if they have at least some college\neducation and unskilled otherwise.34\nIn Table 8, we start by showing that this measure tracks the evolution of inequality well.\nIn column 1, we show that the skill premium increases by 8.3% (column 1) and that this\nincrease is driven by a much faster increase in the wage of skilled workers (+11.8%, column\n2) than unskilled workers (+2.8%, column 3). These magnitudes are actually bigger than the\n32. Another potential way of testing for sorting would be to study the correlation between firm and worker\nfixed effects, but, as Eeckhout and Kircher (2011) and Lopes de Melo (2018) show, this correlation does not\nmeasure the strength of sorting in a general setting.\n33. See Bombardini, Orefice, and Tito (2019) for an application of this method in a trade context.\n34.

Alleviating these concerns requires us to work at\nthe city-by-industry level.

Of\nspecial concern is the far-reaching cash transfer program Bolsa Fam\u00b4 \u0131lia, which was introduced\none year before our reform, in 2003. We think that this concern is unlikely to explain our\nresults for four reasons.\nFirst, this mechanism is inconsistent with some of our results: (i) additional income from\ngovernment programs could serve as a positive income shock, fostering growth by driving up\nlocal demand. This would imply that non-tradable sectors grow faster than tradable sectors,\nwhich is the exact opposite of what we find in Table 4. (ii) While government transfers\n42can affect income inequality, there is no reason it should affect wage inequality a priori. A\npossible connection would be that higher government transfers increase the reservation wage\nof workers, but this would imply an increase in workers\u2019 bargaining power that should mostly\nbenefit workers at the bottom of the wage distribution, thereby predicting a reduction in wage\ninequality rather than the increase we find in Figure 8.\nSecond, the most ambitious programs, such as Bolsa Fam\u00b4 \u0131lia, are distributed directly by\ngovernment-owned banks", "article_title": "FinancialInclusionEvidenceBrazil", "full_section_title": "", "block_type": "text", "language": "en", "last_edit_date": "2024-01-01", "num_tokens": 272}

Since our control cities have a branch of a public bank by design,\nthis implies that control cities have the same access as treated cities to government programs\ndisbursed through government-controlled banks.\nThird, we show in Figure 3that treated and control cities are similar in their government\nexpenditures, as well as in the likelihood that the mayor is affiliated with Lula\u2019s party (the\nWorker\u2019s Party). Therefore, even if, post 2004, the Lula government decided to expand social\ntransfers particularly to places with more left-leaning voters, both treated and control cities\nwould benefit from such an expansion in the same way.\nFourth, we test if the point estimates for our main outcomes are affected when we directly\ncontrol for total local government expenditures or the political affiliation of the mayor. We\nshow in Appendix Table A5that our results remain quantitatively the same when controlling\nonly for local government expenditures (column 14), whether the mayor is affiliated to Lula\u2019s\nparty (column 15) or both at the same time (column 16) . The inclusion of these controls\nimply that the effect of the reform is estimated by comparing cities that have similar political\ninclinations and welfare spending. We also show in Appendix Table A6that results are\nsimilar when we include state \u00d7year fixed effects, implying that differences in state-level welfare\nprograms or differences in political incentives at the state level cannot explain our results", "article_title": "FinancialInclusionEvidenceBrazil", "full_section_title": "", "block_type": "text", "language": "en", "last_edit_date": "2024-01-01", "num_tokens": 296}

Inequalities might increase for instance because following the\nreform, more low productivity workers enter the sample, pushing the mean wage of low-\nskill workers downward. We investigate this possibility in Table 12, in which we measure\ninequality using the city-level variance of log wage.36This allows us to measure wages as the\nresidual of a Mincer equation including different worker characteristics", "article_title": "FinancialInclusionEvidenceBrazil", "full_section_title": "", "block_type": "text", "language": "en", "last_edit_date": "2024-01-01", "num_tokens": 302}

We complement these results\nby controlling for the city-level employment in the informal sector from the 2000 Census,\nwhich we include as one of controls in column (6) of Table A5in the Appendix.

In this section, we discuss how our estimates relate to\nmacro-development models and summarize key moments that these models may target.\nRole of access to financial intermediaries. Our results highlight the importance of bank\nentry and financial inclusion on economic development. One recent model that explicitly\nconsiders how the distance to the nearest bank affects the cost and availability of both credit\nand savings instruments, such as deposits, is Ji, Teng, and Townsend (2023). In this model,\nthe amount of borrowing depends on the share of wealth that entrepreneurs can pledge (i.e", "article_title": "FinancialInclusionEvidenceBrazil", "full_section_title": "", "block_type": "text", "language": "en", "last_edit_date": "2024-01-01", "num_tokens": 261}
{"id": "FinancialInclusionEvidenceBrazil_89", "content_string": ".e.,\nthe tightness of the borrowing constraint), which is itself a function of cash savings, deposit\nsavings and an upfront market-specific credit entry cost. Both the upfront credit entry cost\nand the cost of adjusting balances on interest-earning savings products depend linearly on the\ndistance to the nearest bank. Table 1 of Ji, Teng, and Townsend (2023) reports calibrating\nthe slope of the credit entry cost to the sensitivity of loan access to bank distance and of the\nportfolio adjustment cost to the sensitivity of the deposit-to-cash ratio to bank distance, with\nboth sensitivities being obtained from empirical correlations.\nOur estimates of the effect of financial inclusion on credit and deposits can provide causal\nmoments to help identify the slope of the relationship between bank distance and the credit\nentry cost and the portfolio adjustment cost, respectively. As we discuss in Section 5, our\nresults are best interpreted as the effect of bank entry or, alternatively, as a reduction in the\ndistance to the nearest bank to zero.40\nTo map more closely the parameters used in macro-models, we re-estimate equation (1)\n40. The pre-reform average distance to the nearest bank for treated cities is 8.66 kilometers. Restricting\nattention to treated cities initially without a private bank, the pre-reform average distance to the nearest bank\nis 23.59 kilometers.\n46using credit and deposits among new branches scaled by the city GDP.

A broader class of models does not\nexplicitly consider the extensive margin of access to credit but includes credit market frictions\nthat, when severe enough, will imply that the economy operates close to autarky.42Our\nresults are most supportive of frictions relating to monitoring costs, such as credit entry\ncosts or intermediation costs (e.g", "article_title": "FinancialInclusionEvidenceBrazil", "full_section_title": "", "block_type": "text", "language": "en", "last_edit_date": "2024-01-01", "num_tokens": 258}

The results on economic development that we present in Table 3can be used to\nevaluate model predictions as a response to a reduction in financial frictions that leads to an\nincrease in new loans corresponding to 1.7% (lower bound) to 3.2% (upper bound) of GDP.\nHowever, we highlight that our results most likely speak to the effect of financial inclusion and\nnot simply a credit expansion where credit is already available. The large effect on economic\ndevelopment that we identify, which is considerably larger for treated cities that are farther\naway from a nearby bank (Table 5), points toward the existence of a non-linearity around\nvery low levels of external finance. In that case, this evaluation would only be appropriate in\nan environment where the baseline level of financial frictions is severe enough to imply that\nthere is initially little to no credit.\nImportance of worker heterogeneity. In the workhorse model of occupational choice\nwith financial constraints (e.g., Gin\u00b4 e and Townsend, 2004; Buera, Kaboski, and Shin, 2011),\n41. The average GDP per capita of treated cities between 2000 and 2014 is BRL 9,212.05.\n42", "article_title": "FinancialInclusionEvidenceBrazil", "full_section_title": "", "block_type": "text", "language": "en", "last_edit_date": "2024-01-01", "num_tokens": 338}
{"id": "FinancialInclusionEvidenceBrazil_92", "content_string": ".05.\n42. The literature so far has mostly modeled three types of financial constraints: credit entry costs, which\ncapture fixed transaction costs to access credit; a collateral constraint, which limits loan amounts by pledgeable\nassets; and intermediation costs, modeled as a wedge between the interest rate charged on loans and the deposit\nrate. A recent paper by Dabla-Norris, Ji, Townsend, and Unsal (2021) offers a framework to include the three\nfrictions directly in a standard macro-development model.\n47agents are heterogeneous in wealth and entrepreneurial productivity, and can choose to be\nworkers or entrepreneurs. If they decide to be a worker, they are paid the equilibrium wage.43\nTherefore, while the average wage is affected by who becomes an entrepreneur\u2014as this affects\naggregate labor demand and supply\u2014the gains accrue equally to all workers, as individuals\nare homogeneous in their labor productivity.\nThe type of inequality that this class of models is able to study is therefore wealth in-\nequality, or income inequality, i.e., the sum of capital income (which is the business income of\nentrepreneurs and the interest income households obtain from interest-bearing saving prod-\nucts) and labor income. In this case, capital income is usually a force that pushes income\ninequality up with financial development, and labor income is a force that pushes income\ninequality down.\nOur paper focuses on labor income inequality (i.e., wage inequality)", "article_title": "FinancialInclusionEvidenceBrazil", "full_section_title": "", "block_type": "text", "language": "en", "last_edit_date": "2024-01-01", "num_tokens": 296}

It shows that wage\ninequality increases with financial development when workers are heterogeneous, suggesting\nthat incorporating skill heterogeneity in macro-finance development models is important to\nfully explain how finance affects inequality. Indeed, even in a country like Brazil, the vast ma-\njority of the population are workers and not entrepreneurs. This is important because, while\nincome inequality is likely larger than wage inequality, wage inequality potentially matters a\ngreat deal for aggregate inequality. According to the 2000 Census, we find that the Gini wage\ninequality index among employees is 0.54, barely smaller than the total income inequality\nindex of 0.60 among the total population (employees plus entrepreneurs).44\n9 Conclusion\nIn this paper, we show that the expansion of financial access and capital deepening promoted\nby the Brazilian government led to a permanent increase in economic development, driven\nboth by an expansion of existing businesses and an increase in firm creation, which accelerated\nthe exit of existing firms. These effects materialize over time, underlying the need to study a\nlong-enough period to capture the true effect of one-time reforms on long-run development.\nThis important economic development triggered a substantial rise in wage inequality, which\nis mostly explained by the limited supply of skilled labor in some cities", "article_title": "FinancialInclusionEvidenceBrazil", "full_section_title": "", "block_type": "text", "language": "en", "last_edit_date": "2024-01-01", "num_tokens": 268}
{"id": "FinancialInclusionEvidenceBrazil_94", "content_string": ". This result raises the\nquestion of whether governments should also implement simultaneous labor-oriented policies\nin order to reap the full benefit of formal financial market policies.\n43. A notable exception is Cagetti and De Nardi (2006) who allows individuals to have different productivity\nas workers and entrepreneurs, but focus on wealth inequality.\n44. The fact that a large part of the Gini index of total income is explained by wages in the aggregate is not\nthat surprising since, in Brazil, over 72% of the population are employees and not entrepreneurs. This high\nfraction confirms that understanding the drivers of wage inequality among employees is an important avenue\nfor better understanding how financing frictions affect aggregate inequality.\n48The importance of financial inclusion also has potential implications for current and future\npolicy on digital banking. Such policies are already underway in some developing countries\nwith the goal of expanding financial access, including in Brazil with the launch of an instant\npayment platform (Pix) and its mandatory use by all financial institutions and payment\ninstitutions that are licensed by the Central Bank of Brazil. This initiative, by improving\ndeposit provisions and lowering costs of access to liquidity services, should boost development\nand firm growth, particularly in tradable industries", "article_title": "FinancialInclusionEvidenceBrazil", "full_section_title": "", "block_type": "text", "language": "en", "last_edit_date": "2024-01-01", "num_tokens": 249}
{"id": "FinancialInclusionEvidenceBrazil_95", "content_string": ". However, whether this initiative alone\nwill achieve its intended goals or if, instead, it would be complementary with the expansion of\nphysical bank branches remains an open debate. It might well be the case that the expected\ngains from Pix will materialize mostly in places where households and businesses are already\nbanked if the initial connection to the formal finance sector requires the physical presence of\na bank branch.\nOur results also imply that policies such as digital banking that increase financial inclusion\nfor retail customers and for small and medium-sized enterprises could be a source of substantial\nincrease in inequality in the future if they interact with other frictions, such as the limited\nsupply of human capital, that are prevalent in many developing countries.\nReferences\nAbowd, John, Francis Kramarz, and David Margolis. 1999. \u201cHigh Wage Workers and High Wage Firms.\u201d Econometrica 67 (2):\n251\u2013333.\nAngrist, Joshua, and J\u00a8 orn-Steffen Pischke. 2008.

National Bureau of Economics\nResearch.\n52A.1 Appendix\nFOR ONLINE PUBLICATION\nA.2 Why do banking deserts exist in developing coun-\ntries?\nThe permanent shift in deposits and credit, together with the sustained effect on economic\nactivity that the financial inclusion policy triggered, implies that treated cities that received\na bank branch were profitable markets. Then why did banks not serve these markets prior to\nthe reform? Two reasons can explain this pattern.\nFirst, on the revenue side, monopolistic competition and downward-sloping demand curves\nimply that banks can maximize their markups and hence their profits by restricting quantities,\nwhich will restrict bank expansion.45The limit on bank network expansion will be amplified\nwhen the uncertainty about the profitability of possible markets is high (e.g., Hellmann,\nMurdock, and Stiglitz, 1997), which is likely the case for many smaller cities in a developing\ncountry like Brazil.46\nSecond, on the cost side, the existence of fixed costs to set up a branch and the need to\nminimize the distance across branches to minimize costs implies that banks do not decide on\nbranch locations in an unconstrained way, but instead will extend their network in a capillary\nway and up to a certain limit, particularly in a country as geographically large as Brazil.\nTherefore, cities where banks would be profitable if historical branch networks were different\nmay remain unbanked", "article_title": "FinancialInclusionEvidenceBrazil", "full_section_title": "", "block_type": "text", "language": "en", "last_edit_date": "2024-01-01", "num_tokens": 297}

Maximizing bank mark-up will result in cities not having a branch under the hypothesis that the geo-\ngraphical market served by a branch can be larger than the administrative unit \u201ccity.\u201d While our data does\nnot allow us to provide direct evidence, this idea is consistent with our results on distance to bank branches\nacross cities in Section 5.2.2 and in line with the findings in Assuncao, Mityakov, and Townsend (2020).\n46. This puzzling feature of limited bank expansion to lower margin but profitable markets is actually a\nfeature that has been found in many countries, including developed countries with an active financial sector\nlike the US. See C\u00b4 elerier and Matray (2019) for evidence and references on this phenomenon.\n47. A way to model why profit-maximizing private banks would not enter following the entry of public banks\nis to have a model where public banks maximize profits while, at the same time, caring about total financial\naccess. Assuncao, Mityakov, and Townsend (2020) shows that such a model can explain well the geographical\nexpansion pattern of government-controlled banks vs. private banks in Thailand", "article_title": "FinancialInclusionEvidenceBrazil", "full_section_title": "", "block_type": "text", "language": "en", "last_edit_date": "2024-01-01", "num_tokens": 294}

Filiz Unsal\nNBER Working Paper No. 20821\nJanuary 2015\nJEL No. C54,E23,E44,E69,O11,O16,O57\n ABSTRACT \nWe develop a micro-founded general equilibrium model with heterogeneous agents to identify pertinent\nconstraints to financial inclusion. We evaluate quantitatively the policy impacts of relaxing each of\nthese constraints separately, and in combination, on GDP and inequality. We focus on three dimensions\nof financial inclusion: access (determined by the size of participation costs), depth (determined by\nthe size of collateral constraints resulting from limited commitment), and intermediation efficiency\n(determined by the size of interest rate spreads and default possibilities due to costly monitoring).\nWe take the model to firm-level data from the World Bank Enterprise Survey and World Development\nIndicators for six countries at varying degrees of economic development \u2013 three low income countries\n(Uganda, Kenya, Mozambique), and three emerging market countries (Malaysia, the Philippines, and\nEgypt).

The record on \fnancial inclusion, however, has not kept apace. Large amounts of credit\ndo not always correspond to broad use of \fnancial services, as credit is often concentrated among\nthe largest \frms. Moreover, \frms in developing countries evidently continue to face barriers in\naccessing \fnancial services. For instance, 95 percent of \frms in advanced economies have access to\na bank loan or line of credit as compared with 58 percent in developing economies, and 20 percent\nin low-income countries (Figure I). Collateral requirements for loans, which impose borrowing\nconstraints on \frms, are also 2-3 times as high in developing countries as compared to advanced\neconomies. Similarly, interest rate spreads (the di\u000berence between lending and deposit rates) tend\nto be much higher than in advanced economies", "article_title": "w20821", "full_section_title": "", "block_type": "text", "language": "en", "last_edit_date": "2024-01-01", "num_tokens": 348}
{"id": "w20821_3", "content_string": ". Firms also di\u000ber in terms of their own identi\fcation\nof access to \fnance as a major obstacle to their operations and growth: in developing economies, 35\npercent of small \frms report that access to \fnance is a major obstacle to their operations, compared\nwith 25 percent of large \frms, and 8 percent of large \frms in advanced economies (Figure II).1\nThese considerations warrant a tractable framework that allows for a systematic examination of\nthe linkages between \fnancial inclusion, GDP, and inequality. Moreover, there is a need for better\nunderstanding of the economic channels through which these relationships are sustained. Given\nthat \fnancial inclusion is multi-dimensional, involving both participation barriers and \fnancial\nfrictions that constrain credit availability, policy implications to foster \fnancial inclusion are likely\nto vary across countries. In this paper, we develop a micro-founded general equilibrium model to\naddress these issues. This approach o\u000bers a consistent framework to elucidate the linkages between\n\fnancial inclusion, GDP, and inequality, and to quantify the impact of speci\fc policy changes. This\ncan help guide policy makers in prioritizing between di\u000berent \fnancial sector policies depending\nupon their goals. In the concluding section of this paper, we summarize typical micro level policy\ndiscussions, and our goal is to advance these discussions by tracing out macro general equilibrium\nimpacts.\n[Figure 1 about here", "article_title": "w20821", "full_section_title": "", "block_type": "text", "language": "en", "last_edit_date": "2024-01-01", "num_tokens": 317}

Entrepreneurs have\naccess to a technology that uses capital and labor for production. In equilibrium, only talented\nindividuals with a certain level of wealth choose to become entrepreneurs. Untalented individuals,\nor those who are talented but wealth-constrained, are unable to start a pro\ftable business, choosing\n1This problem is more acute for \frms in the informal sector.

Thus, occupational choices determine how individuals can save\nand also what risks they can bear, with long-run implications for growth and the distribution of\nincome.\n[Figure 2 about here.]\nThe model features an economy with two \\\fnancial regimes\", one with credit and one with\nsavings only. Individuals in the savings regime can save (i.e., make a deposit in \fnancial institutions\nto transfer wealth over time) but cannot borrow. Participation in the savings regime is free, but\nindividuals must pay a participation cost to borrow", "article_title": "w20821", "full_section_title": "", "block_type": "text", "language": "en", "last_edit_date": "2024-01-01", "num_tokens": 270}

The size of this participation cost is one of\nthe determinants of \fnancial inclusion, capturing the \fxed transactions costs and high annual fees,\ndocumentation requirements, and other access barriers facing \frms in developing countries. This is\nin short a variable which captures the various nuanced dimensions of credit access elaborated in\nthe concluding section.\nOnce in the credit regime, individuals can obtain credit, but its size is constrained by two\nadditional types of \fnancial frictions|limited commitment and asymmetric information. These\ndistort the allocation of capital and entrepreneurial talent in the economy, lowering aggregate\ntotal factor productivity (TFP). The \frst \fnancial friction is modeled as collateral constraints,\nwhich arise from the imperfect enforceability of contracts. Entrepreneurs have to post collateral in\norder to borrow. The amount/value of collateral is thus another determinant of \fnancial inclusion,\na\u000becting the amount of the credit available. The second \fnancial friction arises from asymmetric\ninformation between banks and borrowers. In this environment, interest rates charged on borrowing\nmust cover the cost of monitoring of highly-leveraged \frms. Because more productive and poorer\nagents are more likely to be highly leveraged, the ensuing higher intermediation cost is another\nsource of ine\u000eciency and \fnancial exclusion", "article_title": "w20821", "full_section_title": "", "block_type": "text", "language": "en", "last_edit_date": "2024-01-01", "num_tokens": 276}
{"id": "w20821_6", "content_string": ". As only highly leveraged \frm are monitored, \frms\nface di\u000berential costs of capital and may choose not to borrow even when credit is available.\nIn our model, greater \fnancial inclusion impacts GDP and inequality primarily through two\nchannels. First, it allows for a more e\u000ecient allocation of funds among entrepreneurs, thereby\nincreasing aggregate output. This occurs as funds are channeled to talented entrepreneurs, increasing\ntheir output disproportionately more than that of less-talented ones. Second, more e\u000ecient \fnancial\ncontracts limit waste from \fnancial frictions (e.g., the credit participation and monitoring costs)\nleading to higher GDP. If higher output is achieved through the reallocation of funds to more\ntalented entrepreneurs, who are already receiving a higher income than other agents, income\ninequality can rise. However, \fnancial inclusion through lower credit participation costs can also\ncrowd-in relatively untalented agents, resulting in a decrease in income inequality. This underlines\nthe trade-o\u000b between GDP and inequality.\nWe calibrate the model using data from the World Bank Enterprise Surveys and World Devel-\nopment Indicators. The Enterprise Survey is a \frm-level survey of a representative sample of \frms\n3in an economy. The surveys cover a broad range of business environment topics including access\nto \fnance, corruption, infrastructure, crime, competition, and performance measures", "article_title": "w20821", "full_section_title": "", "block_type": "text", "language": "en", "last_edit_date": "2024-01-01", "num_tokens": 302}

We jointly\nchoose the model's key parameters to match the simulated moments, such as the percent of \frms\nwith credit and the \frm employment distribution, as well as the economy-wide non-performing\nloans ratio, and interest rate spread. We calibrate the model separately for six developing countries\nat varying degrees of economic development: three low-income countries (Uganda in 2005, Kenya\nin 2006, and Mozambique in 2006), and three emerging market economies (Malaysia in 2006,\nPhilippines in 2007, and Egypt in 2007). Although \fnancial systems in emerging market economies\nare more developed than in low-income countries, this does not hold for every dimension of \fnancial\ninclusion. For example, the collateral requirement in the Philippines is 238.4% of the loan amount,\nwhich is higher than the requirement in Uganda, Kenya and Mozambique. Moreover, di\u000berent\ndimensions of \fnancial inclusion vary signi\fcantly even within countries at a similar stage of\neconomic development. For example, Kenya outperforms Uganda and Mozambique in terms of the\npercentage of \frms with access to credit, but the collateral requirement is more stringent.\nThe quantitative model developed in this paper enables us to examine the impact of various\n\fnancial inclusion policies on GDP, income inequality (as measured by the Gini coe\u000ecient) and\noverall welfare. The model simulations suggest that the impact of \fnancial inclusion policies\ndepends upon country-speci\fc characteristics", "article_title": "w20821", "full_section_title": "", "block_type": "text", "language": "en", "last_edit_date": "2024-01-01", "num_tokens": 329}
{"id": "w20821_8", "content_string": ". For example, Uganda's GDP is most responsive\nto a relaxation of borrowing/collateral constraints. This is because \frms in Uganda are severely\nconstrained by high collateral requirements, so that reducing intermediation costs only bene\fts a\nsmall number of highly-leveraged \frms. By contrast, high \fxed participation costs are a major\nobstacle to \fnancial inclusion in Malaysia. These results suggest that understanding the speci\fc\nfactors constraining \fnancial inclusion in an economy is critical for tailoring policy advice. The\nfocus of public policy should thus be on ameliorating the most pressing \fnancial frictions.\nThe model simulations also indicate that di\u000berent dimensions of \fnancial inclusion unambiguously\nincrease the economy's TFP as talented entrepreneurs, who desire to operate \frms at a larger scale,\nbene\ft disproportionately. However, they have a di\u000berential impact on GDP and inequality and\nthere are trade-o\u000bs. For example, a decline in participation costs reduces income inequality as\nentrepreneurs living in the savings regime obtain credit and workers receive higher wages. Relaxing\nborrowing constraints, on the other hand, can have an ambiguous impact on inequality, with\ninequality initially increasing and then declining. In other words, a Kuznets-type response can be\ngenerated. In fact, di\u000berent dimensions of \fnancial inclusion can result in di\u000berent distributional\nconsequences", "article_title": "w20821", "full_section_title": "", "block_type": "text", "language": "en", "last_edit_date": "2024-01-01", "num_tokens": 314}

However, in general equilibrium, the resulting changes in interest\nrates and wages can lead to losses for some agents. For example, the policy that is most e\u000bective\nin increasing access (reducing participation costs) bene\fts the poor and talented agents primarily,\nwhile wealthy agents lose due to higher interest rates and wages. By contrast, policies that target\n4\fnancial depth (relaxing borrowing constraints) bene\ft wealthy and talented agents but can impose\nlosses on wealthy but less-talented agents.\nWe also show that there exist rich interactions between di\u000berent dimensions of \fnancial inclusion.\nConducting two policies that target di\u000berent \fnancial frictions simultaneously can lead to a larger\nincrease in GDP for some range of parameter values. However, to the extent that these policies are\nsubstitutes, implementing one policy can reduce the e\u000bectiveness of other policies in boosting GDP.\nThe remainder of the paper is organized as follows.

This theoretical framework\nis \frst introduced by Banerjee and Newman (1993) to capture the process of economic development.\nLloyd-Ellis and Bernhardt (2000) extend the model to explain income inequality and the existence\nof a Kuznets curve. Cagetti and Nardi (2006) build on the framework to show that the introduction\nof a bequest motive generates lifetime savings pro\fles more consistent with data. In these studies,\nimproved \fnancial intermediation leads to greater entry into entrepreneurship, higher productivity\nand investment, and a general equilibrium e\u000bect that increases wages. Moreover, the models suggest\nthat the distribution of wealth or the joint distribution of wealth and productivity is critical.\nA related literature has found sizable impacts of improved \fnancial intermediation on aggregate\nproductivity and income (Gine and Townsend, 2004; Jeong and Townsend, 2007, 2008; Amaral\nand Quintin, 2010; Buera, Kaboski and Shin, 2011; Greenwood, Sanchez and Wang, 2013). Buera,\nKaboski and Shin (2011) incorporate forward-looking agents in an occupational choice framework,\nshowing that \fnancial frictions account for a substantial part of the observed cross-country di\u000berences\nin output per worker and aggregate TFP", "article_title": "w20821", "full_section_title": "", "block_type": "text", "language": "en", "last_edit_date": "2024-01-01", "num_tokens": 324}

They \fnd that the impact of scaling-up micro\fnance\non per-capita income is small, because of the ensuing redistribution of income from high-savers to\nlow-savers, but the vast majority of the population bene\fts from higher wages. Moll (2014) shows\nthat the impact of \fnancial frictions on GDP and TFP depends on the persistence of idiosyncratic\nshocks, and that the short-run e\u000bects of \fnancial frictions tend to be larger than their long-run\nimpacts.\nOur model builds on this occupational choice framework, but with novel features. We focus on\nseveral dimensions of \fnancial inclusion within an economy. Although these dimensions have typically\nbeen considered separately in the previous literature, our paper provides a uni\fed framework for\n5examining them individually as well as jointly. Our model features three types of \fnancial frictions:\n\fxed costs of credit entry, limited commitment, and asymmetric information. Unlike previous\nstudies, our model allows us to also uncover how di\u000berent frictions interact with each other. In this\nsense, our paper is related to studies in which multiple \fnancial frictions co-exist and are compared.\nClementi and Hopenhayn (2006) and Albuquerque and Hopenhayn (2004) argue that moral hazard\nand limited commitment have di\u000berent implications for \frm dynamics", "article_title": "w20821", "full_section_title": "", "block_type": "text", "language": "en", "last_edit_date": "2024-01-01", "num_tokens": 337}

Karaivanov and Townsend (2014) estimate the \fnancial/information regime\nin place for households (including those running businesses) in Thailand and \fnd that a moral\nhazard constrained \fnancial regime \fts the data best in urban areas, while a more limited savings\nregime is more applicable for rural areas.

And what is\nthe impact of alleviating these \fnancial frictions individually or jointly?\nOur paper is also related to a large empirical literature on the real e\u000bects of credit. The view\nthat \fnancial inclusion spurs economic growth is supported by empirical evidence (King and Levine,\n1993; Levine, 2005). Regression-based analyses at the aggregate level reveal a strong correlation\nbetween broad measures of \fnancial depth (such as M2 or credit to GDP) and economic growth.\nFor \frms, access to \fnance is positively associated with innovation, job creation, and growth (Beck,\nDemirg-Kunt and Maksimovic, 2005; Ayyagari, Demirgc-Kunt and Maksimovic, 2008). There is also\nevidence that aggregate \fnancial depth is positively associated with poverty reduction and income\ninequality (Beck, Demirg-Kunt and Levine, 2007; Clarke, Xu and fu Zou, 2006). Cross-sectional\nregression analysis, however, can be problematic as causality cannot easily be established, causal\nmechanisms are di\u000ecult to pin down, and policy evaluation is more challenging. Moreover, the\nimplicit assumptions of stationarity and linearity in regression analysis could be incorrect, even\nafter taking logs and including lags, if these variables lie on complex transitional growth paths\n(Townsend and Ueda, 2006)", "article_title": "w20821", "full_section_title": "", "block_type": "text", "language": "en", "last_edit_date": "2024-01-01", "num_tokens": 333}

The advantage of using a structural framework such as ours lies in\ncapturing salient features of the economy and the pertinent \fnancial sector frictions.\n6Our paper is also broadly related to the literature on misallocation (Hsieh and Klenow, 2009;\nCaselli and Gennaioli, 2013; Midrigan and Xu, 2014; Moll, 2014) and inequality (Davies, 1982;\nHuggett, 1996; Aghion and Bolton, 1997; Castaneda, Diaz-Gimenez and Rios-Rull, 2003; Nardi,\n2004). Our contribution is to show that policy options that target di\u000berent \fnancial sector frictions\nhave di\u000berent impacts on resource allocation and inequality. More importantly, even for the same\npolicy, the impacts on inequality can di\u000ber as these impacts are contingent on country-speci\fc\ncharacteristics.\n3 The Model\nThe economy is populated by a continuum of agents of measure one. Agents are heterogeneous in\nterms of initial wealth band talentz.\nEach agent lives for two periods. In the \frst period, the agent makes credit participation,\noccupational choice, and investment decisions, taking the optimal consumption/bequest decision\nmade in the second period as given. In the second period, the agent realizes income as wage or\nbusiness pro\ft, depending on the occupation, and makes consumption and bequest decisions to\nmaximize utility.

The\nmiddle region represents agents with su\u000ecient wealth to operate a pro\ftable \frm but scale is still\nconstrained by wealth ( k\u0003(b;z)<ks(z)).

Agents in the low-leverage region are not borrowing much\nin the sense that the face value of loan can be repaid even if production fails. Thus, banks do not\nmonitor them, and the lending interest rate is equal to the deposit interest rate, as shown in Figure\nIV. By contrast, agents in the high-leverage region default when production fails, in which case\nbanks monitor and seize the recovered undepreciated working capital and after-interest collateral.\nIn accordance with Proposition 3, the high-leverage region is to the left of the low-leverage region,\nimplying that entrepreneurs would prefer to leverage more when wealth is low to bene\ft from the\nhigh marginal return on capital.\nThe policy options we consider in section 5, move the lines in the occupation map (Figure V),\nand also alter the relative income received by di\u000berent agents.

The other parameters are calibrated to\nmatch the same set of moments as in the baseline model (see Table A.1).

However, there are other di\u000berences. Notably, a reduction in\nintermediation costs has a much larger GDP and TFP boosting e\u000bect as compared to the baseline\nmodel.26One reason for this could be that entrepreneurs response to lower intermediation costs\nby saving more, which is not captured if the savings rate is constant.27The same most-binding-\nconstraint that constrains GDP are identi\fed for all six countries by the two models.

To promote the computation speed, we code the value function iteration and\nwealth distribution iteration parts of the program in C++ (VS studio 2014) and use matlab to call these scripts. At\nthe same time, we use a 20-core server to parallel the computation of heterogeneity. This reduces the computation\ntime of the steady-state to 40 minutes. So more complicated dynamics are within reach, but require more hardware\nand coding, which limits their wide applicability and are still two times slower.\n29As noted before, the calibration for the forward looking model is done by selecting parameter \u0012from the literature,\nwhich is calibrated using the U.S. employment distribution, not the distribution of each country", "article_title": "w20821", "full_section_title": "", "block_type": "text", "language": "en", "last_edit_date": "2024-01-01", "num_tokens": 317}

Similar approaches\nare also seen from several other quantitative papers with forward looking heterogeneous agents (e.g. Buera, Kaboski\nand Shin, 2011; Buera and Shin, 2013; Greenwood, Sanchez and Wang, 2013).\n30Greenwood, Sanchez and Wang (2013, Figure 6) show that this variable re\rects the monitoring e\u000eciency in a\ncross-country analysis.\n32valid.\n7 Conclusion\nWe develop a tractable micro-founded general equilibrium model with heterogeneous agents to\nanalyze the implications of \fnancial inclusion policies on GDP and inequality in developing countries.\nIn particular, we focus on three speci\fc dimensions of greater \fnancial inclusion: access (as measured\nby the size of credit participation costs), depth (as measured by the size of collateral constraints\nresulting from limited commitment), and intermediation e\u000eciency (as measured by the size of\ninterest rate spreads, re\recting default risk and asymmetric information).\nUsing analytical and numerical methods, we calibrate the model for six low-income and emerging\nmarket countries|Uganda, Kenya, Mozambique, Malaysia, the Philippines, and Egypt. While our\nsimulation results are intended to be illustrative, they indicate that relaxing various \fnancial sector\nfrictions may a\u000bect GDP and inequality in di\u000berent ways. Moreover, our \fndings suggest that\ncountry-speci\fc characteristics play a central role in determining the impacts, interactions, and\ntrade-o\u000bs among policies", "article_title": "w20821", "full_section_title": "", "block_type": "text", "language": "en", "last_edit_date": "2024-01-01", "num_tokens": 320}

We then return to macro, general equilibrium consequences.\nPolicies to enhance inclusion encompass developing appropriate legal, regulatory, and institutional\nframeworks and supporting the information environment. The government has a central role to play\nin enhancing \fnancial inclusion by introducing laws that protect property and creditor rights and\nby ensuring that these laws are adequately enforced. This is captured by the parameter \u0015. Indeed,\ncountry experiences suggest that poorly designed and enforced creditor rights discourage lending\nand encourage individuals to default. Improvements in the collateral framework can thus play\nan important role in alleviating borrowing constraints and reducing intermediation costs.

In some countries, buyer-supplier relationships (e.g., trade credit) can also be another valuable\nsource of credit information. Insolvency regimes are also a key aspect of \fnancial infrastructure,\nhelping regulate e\u000ecient exit from markets and providing opportunities for recovery by bankrupt\n33entities and their creditors.\nOther direct interventions aimed speci\fcally at enhancing banking penetration (e.g., low-fee\naccounts, simpli\fed documentation requirements, providing non-\fnancial services to improve\nrecord keeping, improving competition in banking system) can reduce credit participation costs by\nincreasing access to \fnancial services.

The model simulations suggest that\nthe impact of \fnancial inclusion policies do depend greatly upon country-speci\fc characteristics.\nThus understanding the speci\fc constraints generating the lack of \fnancial inclusion in an economy\nis critical for tailoring policy recommendations. Moreover, the model simulations indicate that\ndi\u000berent dimensions of \fnancial inclusion have a di\u000berential impact on GDP and inequality and\nthat there are trade-o\u000bs. There also exist rich interactions among the three dimensions of \fnancial\ninclusion. Policies that address di\u000berent dimensions could be complementary, but it is also likely\nthat implementing one policy reduces the e\u000bectiveness of other policies.\nA de\fning feature of our model is having three di\u000berent types of \fnancial frictions, limited\nparticipation, limited commitment, and asymmetric information (or costly state veri\fcation) all\nembedded in a uni\fed framework. Most of the recent literature has only one. We emphasize\nthat the micro-foundations for each of the three \fnancial frictions included in this paper are very\ndi\u000berent. As just noted, alleviating each \fnancial friction is directly linked to some particular\n\fnancial inclusion policy", "article_title": "w20821", "full_section_title": "", "block_type": "text", "language": "en", "last_edit_date": "2024-01-01", "num_tokens": 314}

Thus a quantitative framework\nthat incorporates multiple types of \fnancial frictions is needed to capture the multifaceted nature\nof \fnancial systems. Even at the aggregate level, alleviating di\u000berent sources of \fnancial frictions\ncan have di\u000berential impacts, either qualitatively or quantitatively, on some macro variables.\nIncorporating these frictions altogether in a uni\fed framework enables us to identify the most\nbinding constraints that hinder \fnancial development within an economy. Moreover, multiple\nfrictions are necessary ingredients to match the data for a wide set of countries. If the only \fnancial\nfriction is limited commitment, relaxing it increases the credit access ratio, interest rate spread,\nand non-performing loans in tandem. However, in the data, the three moments are not perfectly\npositively correlated across countries. For example, Uganda has a high interest rate spread but\nlow non-performing loans, while Egypt is associated with a high non-performing loans ratio and\n34low interest rate spread. It is not possible to match the two moments in both countries without\nallowing for both limited commitment and costly state veri\fcation", "article_title": "w20821", "full_section_title": "", "block_type": "text", "language": "en", "last_edit_date": "2024-01-01", "num_tokens": 310}

I document this fact and I analyze two features of new financial \ntechnologies  that have stirred controversy: returns to scale, and the use of big data and machine \nlearning. I argue that the nature of fixed versus variable costs in robo-advising is likely to \ndemocratize access to financial  services. Big data is likely to reduce the impact of negative \nprejudice in the credit market but it could reduce the effectiveness of existing policies aimed at \nprotecting minorities.\nThomas Philippon\nNew York University\nStern School of Business\n44 West 4th Street, Suite 9-190\nNew York, NY  10012-1126\nand NBER\ntphilipp@stern.nyu.eduFintech covers digital innovations and technology-enable d business model innovations in the \ufb01nancial sector.\nSuch innovations can disrupt existing industry structures and blur industry boundaries, facilitate strategic dis-\nintermediation, change how existing \ufb01rms create and delive r products and services, provide new gateways for\nentrepreneurship, and democratize access to \ufb01nancial serv ices.

In this paper I o\ufb00e r some preliminary evidence and theoretical analysis\nabout the impact of technological progress in the \ufb01nance ind ustry.\nThe \ufb01rst question is whether there has been any material chan ge in \ufb01nancial intermediation in recent years.\nTo shed some light on this question, I update the work of Phili ppon (2015) with post-crisis U.S. data. The puzzle\nemphasized in previous work was that the unit cost of \ufb01nancia l intermediation had remained stubbornly close to 200\nbasis points for more than a century, despite advances \u2013 and l arge investments \u2013 in computers and communication\ntechnologies. The post-crisis data suggests that this puzz le might be diminishing. I \ufb01nd that the unit cost of\n\ufb01nancial intermediation has declined over the past 10 years .\nI then study two issues that are at the heart of the Fintech deb ate: access to \ufb01nance and discrimination. If we\naccept the fact that Fintech brings e\ufb03ciency gains to \ufb01nanci al intermediation, the next question is: how will these\ngains be shared? Will Fintech democratize access to \ufb01nancia l services or will it increase inequality?\nI highlight two forces that will shape the answer to these que stions. The \ufb01rst is increasing returns to scale\nbrought by technology. I illustrate how this force plays out in the context of asset management and robo-advising.\nInvestors select advisors and advisors help them choose the ir investments (Pedersen, 2015). Search costs imply that\nwealthy households have access to better advice", "article_title": "w26330", "full_section_title": "", "block_type": "text", "language": "en", "last_edit_date": "2024-01-01", "num_tokens": 358}
{"id": "w26330_3", "content_string": ". I argue tha t robo-advising and related technologies will change\nthe nature of \ufb01xed costs in a way that is likely to improve acce ss to \ufb01nancial services. It may not, however, reduce\ninequality among all groups.\nThe second force is the use of big data and machine learning (B DML for short). I illustrate how this force plays\nout in the context of consumer credit. I argue that this techn ology is likely to reduce unwarranted human biases\nagainst minorities, but it will probably decrease the e\ufb00ect iveness of existing regulations. The tentative conclusion is\nthat Fintech can bring widely-shared welfare bene\ufb01ts but ch anges in existing policies and regulations are necessary\nto achieve its full potential.\nRecent literature Philippon (2016) discusses the literature up to 2016 so I wil l mention here some recent papers.\nPetralia et al. (2019) discuss the impact of new technologie s on the banking industry. Focusing on residential\nmortgages, Buchak et al. (2018) study the growth in the marke t share of shadow bank and Fintech lenders, arguing\nthat it can be explained by di\ufb00erences in regulation and tech nological advantages. They \ufb01nd that Fintech lenders\n2serve more creditworthy borrowers (relative to shadow bank s) but charge higher interest rates (14-16 basis points),\nwhich is consistent with the idea that consumers are willing to pay for better user experience and quick decisions.\nFuster et al", "article_title": "w26330", "full_section_title": "", "block_type": "text", "language": "en", "last_edit_date": "2024-01-01", "num_tokens": 327}

(2019) study the di\ufb00erences between Fintech an d traditional lenders in the mortgage market and\n\ufb01nd that the former is quicker in processing applications (2 0% faster), without increasing loan risk. They also\nprovide evidence that Fintech lenders adjust supply more el astically to demand shocks and increase the propensity\nto re\ufb01nance, especially among borrowers that are likely to b ene\ufb01t from it. Their results suggest that Fintech \ufb01rms\nhave improved the e\ufb03ciency of \ufb01nancial intermediation in mo rtgage markets.\nThe advent of Fintech is often seen as a promising avenue for r educing inequality in access to credit. Bartlett\net al.

In 2017, it accounted for more than half o f all investments in robo-advisors (Abraham et al.,\n2019). Nevertheless, the amount of assets managed by robo-a dvisors is still a small portion of total assets under\nmanagement, with average client wealth much smaller than th e average in the industry (Economist, 2017). Abraham\net al. (2019) argues that because they save on \ufb01xed costs (suc h as salaries of \ufb01nancial advisors or maintenance of\nphysical o\ufb03ces), robo-advisors can reduce minimum investm ent requirements and charge lower fees. Finally, one\narea that is not well developed is the study of the interactio n between Fintech and incentives within organizations.\nThis is likely to be relevant for discrimination and other bi ases.

This section o \ufb00ers an update of this work.\n1.1 Financial Expenses and Intermediated Assets\nTo organize the discussion I use a simple model economy consi sting of households, a non-\ufb01nancial business sector,\nand a \ufb01nancial intermediation sector. The details of the mod el are in the Appendix. The income share of \ufb01nance,\n3shown in Figure 1, is de\ufb01ned as1\nyf\nt\nyt=Value Added of Finance Industry\nGDP.\nThe model assumes that \ufb01nancial services are produced under constant returns to scale. The income of the \ufb01nance\nindustryyf\ntis then given by\nyf\nt=\u03c8c,tbc,t+\u03c8m,tmt+\u03c8k,tkt, (1)\nwherebc,tis consumer credit, mtare assets providing liquidity services, and ktis the value of intermediated corporate\nassets. The parameters \u03c8i,t\u2019s are the unit cost of intermediation, pinned down by the int ermediation technology.\nThe model therefore says that the income of the \ufb01nance indust ry is proportional to the quantity of intermediated\nassets, properly de\ufb01ned. The model predicts no income e\ufb00ect , i.e., no tendency for the \ufb01nance income share to grow\nwith per-capita GDP. This does not mean that the \ufb01nance incom e share should be constant, since the ratio of assets\nto GDP can change. But it says that the income share does not gr ow mechanically with total factor productivity.\nThis is consistent with the historical evidence.2\nMeasuring intermediated assets is complicated because the se assets are heterogenous. As far as corporate \ufb01nance\nis concerned, the model is fundamentally a user cost model", "article_title": "w26330", "full_section_title": "", "block_type": "text", "language": "en", "last_edit_date": "2024-01-01", "num_tokens": 381}

I mprovements in corporate \ufb01nance (a decrease in \u03c8k)\nlower the user cost of capital and increase the capital stock , which, from a theoretical perspective, should include\nall intangible investments and should be measured at market value. A signi\ufb01cant part of the growth of the \ufb01nance\nindustry over the past 30 years is linked to household credit . The model provides a simple way to model household\n\ufb01nance. The model also incorporates liquidity services pro vided by speci\ufb01c liabilities (deposits, checking accounts ,\nsome form of repurchase agreements) issued by \ufb01nancial inte rmediaries. One can always write the RHS of (1) as\n\u03c8c,t/parenleftBig\nbc,t+\u03c8m,t\n\u03c8c,tmt+\u03c8k,t\n\u03c8c,tkt/parenrightBig\n.

This is the correct way to do the accounting, r ather than looking at the balance sheet of \ufb01nancial\n1Philippon (2015) discusses various issues of measurement. Conceptually, the best measure is value added, which is the s um of\npro\ufb01ts and wages. Whenever possible, I therefore use the GDP share of the \ufb01nance industry, i.e., the nominal value added o f the \ufb01nance\nindustry divided by the nominal GDP of the U.S. economy. One i ssue, however, is that before 1945 pro\ufb01ts are not always prop erly\nmeasured and value added is not available", "article_title": "w26330", "full_section_title": "", "block_type": "text", "language": "en", "last_edit_date": "2024-01-01", "num_tokens": 429}
{"id": "w26330_8", "content_string": ". As an alternative measure I then use the labor compensation share of the \ufb01nance industry,\ni.e., the compensation of all employees of the \ufb01nance indust ry divided by the compensation of all employees in the U.S. ec onomy.\nPhilippon (2015) also explains the robustness of the main \ufb01n dings to large changes in government spending (because of wa rs), the rise\nof services (\ufb01nance as a share of services displays a similar pattern to the one presented here), globalization (netting out imports and\nexports of \ufb01nancial services).\n2The fact that the \ufb01nance share of GDP is the same in 1925 and in 1 980 makes is already clear that there is no mechanical relati onship\nbetween GDP per capita and the \ufb01nance income share. Similarl y, Bickenbach et al. (2009) show that the income share of \ufb01nan ce has\nremained remarkably constant in Germany over the past 30 yea rs. More precisely, using KLEMS for Europe (see O\u2019Mahony and Timmer\n(2009)) one can see that the \ufb01nance share in Germany was 4.3% i n 1980, 4.68% in 1990, 4.19% in 2000, and 4.47% in 2006.\n3This is true most of the time, but not when quality adjustment s are too large.

Figure 3\nshows the quality adjusted unit cost series. It is lower than the unadjusted series by construction since quality\nadjusted assets are (weakly) larger than raw intermediated assets.

This i ncrease is concentrated at the bottom of the income distribu tion. For\nhouseholds in the 0-40 percentiles of income, the fraction w ith some debt outstanding goes from 53% to 61% between 1989 an d 2007.\nIn the mortgage market, Mayer and Pence (2008) show that subp rime originations account for 15% to 20% of all HMDA originat ions\nin 2005.\n6Figure 3: Unit Cost and Quality Adjustment0 .005 .01 .015 .02 .025 .03\n1880 1900 1920 1940 1960 1980 2000 2020\ntime\nRaw Quality AdjustedUnit Cost, with Quality Adjustment\nNotes: The quality adjusted measure takes into account chan ges in \ufb01rms\u2019 and households\u2019 characteristics.

{"id": "w26330_12", "content_string": ". The key point is that there are two types of \ufb01xed costs: \ufb01xed costs to\nset up a business or a system or a platform; and then \ufb01xed cost p er relationship with each client.\nThere is a continuum of mass 1 of households whose wealth wis distributed according to the (cumulative)\ndistribution G(w). Households are risk neutral (or, equivalently, returns ar e risk adjusted) and have access to an\ninvestment technology with gross return r. The reservation utility of a household is thus rw. Households also have\nthe option to hire an asset manager in order to earn higher ret urns.\n2.1 Traditional Asset Management Equilibrium\nThere areNasset managers with access to an investment technology with returnR > r . To be active they need\nto pay the \ufb01xed cost \u03a6(per active \ufb01rm). To work with a household they need to pay the relationship cost \u03c6(per\nclient). The asset management industry is oligopolistic an d asset managers charge a fee f(w)for their services. I\nrestrict attention to linear fees of the form f(w) =\u03c6+\u00b5w, where the intercept covers the \ufb01xed cost and where \u00b5\nis a markup. For now the markup is simply a parameter but, as di scussed later, it could be a decreasing function\nof the number of active intermediaries. The parameters are s uch that\u00b5<R\u2212r.\nThe key decision for a household is whether to hire an asset ma nager or not.

In the limit, we can even imagine that\n\u03c6\u2032= 0. The existing literature has failed to capture the di\ufb00erenc e between these two types of \ufb01xed costs. I will\nshow that they have di\ufb00erent welfare implications.\nHouseholds now have three options. They can invest by themse lves and earn r. They can hire a traditional\nmanager. Or they can hire a robo advisor. There are now two cut o\ufb00s to calculate w1andw2, one for the\nparticipation decision (as before) and one for the choice of the type of asset manager.

For most\nof the post-war era, banks have relied on the credit history o f consumers to make lending decisions. Exactly how\nthese borrowing histories are compiled can di\ufb00er from count ry to country, but the broad principles are similar. In\nthe U.S", "article_title": "w26330", "full_section_title": "", "block_type": "text", "language": "en", "last_edit_date": "2024-01-01", "num_tokens": 341}
{"id": "w26330_18", "content_string": ". In\nthe U.S. for example, lenders (banks, mortgage lenders, cre dit card companies, \ufb01nancing companies) feed data on\ntheir customers to credit-reporting \ufb01rms (credit bureaus) , such as Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion. These \ufb01rms\naggregate the data and create \ufb01les (credit reports) on consu mers. The same \ufb01rms (e.g. Experian or Equifax), or\nothers, can then create credit scores. In the U.S., another c ompany, Fair Isaac Corporation, or FICO, has developed\nthe most widely-used score, the FICO score, which ranges fro m 300 to 850. Some lenders base their credit decisions\nalmost entirely on FICO score, while others also consider mo re detailed credit bureau reports.\nIn recent years credit companies have started using new sour ces of data on consumer behavior, such as phone\nbills, shopping histories, subscriptions, or browsing his tories. These data are less structured than traditional one s\nand new lenders often rely on machine learning algorithms to exploit them e\ufb00ectively. I will therefore refer to\nthe whole process as big data and machine learning, or BDML fo r short. BDML is useful since many potential\nborrowers are not properly scored by traditional methods. I n the U.S. for example about 50 million adults do not\nhave a FICO score, and another 50 million have subprime score s that are notoriously noisy. One can hope that\nBDML will help bring credit to deserving borrowers who lack r eliable scores", "article_title": "w26330", "full_section_title": "", "block_type": "text", "language": "en", "last_edit_date": "2024-01-01", "num_tokens": 338}
{"id": "w26330_19", "content_string": ". On the other hand, regulators worry\nthat BDML could inadvertently introduce new forms of discri mination or reactivate old ones. In the US, the Equal\nCredit Opportunity Act and the Fair Housing Act make it illeg al for a creditor to discriminate based on race, color,\nreligion or gender. I will therefore study the interaction b etween new technologies and existing regulations.\n3.1 Setup\nAs in the case of robo-advising, I describe a simple model and then I ask how Fintech might a\ufb00ect the equilibrium.\nThe basic model follows the classic paper of Aigner and Cain ( 1977). There is a one-dimensional variable qthat\ncaptures the credit quality of an individual. The distribut ion ofqis normal with mean \u00afqand variance \u00af\u03c32. I use\n\u2019bars\u2019 to denote population averages and also, under ration al expectations, unconditional beliefs. It is convenient\nto work with precisions instead of variances so I de\ufb01ne\n\u00af\u03c4\u22611\n\u00af\u03c32.\nAll lenders observe a quantitative signal y1about the credit quality of the borrower:\ny1=q+\u01eb1,\n11where\u01eb1is normal with mean 0and precision \u03c41. We can think of y1as a standard credit score. After observing\nthe signaly1, the conditional distribution of qis normal with mean\nE[q|y1] =\u00af\u03c4\u00afq+\u03c41y1\n\u00af\u03c4+\u03c41\nand precision \u00af\u03c4+\u03c41. Now imagine that the population includes two groups, denot ed byz: a majority group z=A,\nand a minority group z=B. If a lender can condition on group membership the condition al expectation becomes\nE[q|y1,z] =\u00af\u03c4\u00afqz+\u03c41zy1\n\u00af\u03c4+\u03c41z", "article_title": "w26330", "full_section_title": "", "block_type": "text", "language": "en", "last_edit_date": "2024-01-01", "num_tokens": 390}
{"id": "w26330_20", "content_string": ".\nI assume that the minority group has a weakly lower average cr edit quality, \u00afqB\u2264\u00afqA. For simplicity I assume that\n\u00af\u03c4A= \u00af\u03c4Bis the same for both groups but it is easy to allow for di\ufb00erent population variances. A classic argument\nin the literature on discrimination is that standard data fa vor the majority, in the sense that \u03c41B<\u03c41A. The lesser\nprecision of traditional signals could arise from a higher p revalence of missing data in the minority. For instance,\nif they are less likely to be employed, minorities have fewer payroll statements. If they are less likely to get a loan,\nthey have shorter histories of repayments.\nDiscrimination can take several forms. Statistical discri mination refers to the fact that, as long as the signal y1\nis noisy, the posterior puts a positive weight on the prior. A s a consequence, for a given signal y1, a member of\nthe majority will receive a better score than a member of the m inority.5Under statistical discrimination, however,\nthere is no average bias since the average of a conditional ex pectation is correct and equal to the true population\nmean:E[E[q|y1,z]] = \u00afqzfor allz. Aigner and Cain (1977) and others have argued that statisti cal discrimination\nis unlikely to explain all \u2013 or even most \u2013 of the discriminati on that we observe empirically. Dobbie et al.

I therefore consider the stronger issue of\nprejudice in lending decisions.\n3.2 Traditional Lenders\nTraditional lenders meet face-to-face with borrowers. Thi s has two consequences: they observe directly the type z,\nand they generate another signal u=q+\u01ebuabout credit quality with precision \u03c4u. With two signals the conditional\ndistribution of qis normal with mean\nE[q|y1,z] =\u00af\u03c4\u00afqz+\u03c4uu+\u03c41zy1\n\u00af\u03c4+\u03c4u+\u03c41z,\n5Suppose for simplicity that \u03c41B=\u03c41A. ThenE[q|y1,A]\u2212E[q|y1,B] =\u03c4q(\u00afqA\u2212\u00afqB)\n\u03c4q+\u03c41.\n12and precision \u00af\u03c4+\u03c41+\u03c4u. I assume that loan o\ufb03cers have a biased belief about the mino rity. They perceive the\naverage quality to be \u02c6qB= \u00afqB\u2212\u03b4. We can think of \u03b4as arising from prejudice or negative stereotyping. The\nconditional expectation of the lender is then\n\u02c6E(y1,u,B) =\u00af\u03c4(\u00afqB\u2212\u03b4)+\u03c4uu+\u03c41By1\n\u00af\u03c4+\u03c4u+\u03c41B.\nNote that the average statistical bias is simply E/bracketleftBig\n\u02c6E(y1,u,B)|B/bracketrightBig\n\u2212\u00afqB=\u2212\u00af\u03c4\n\u00af\u03c4+\u03c4u+\u03c41B\u03b4.The harm potentially\nimposed on the minority is stronger if the prejudice \u03b4is large and if the signal is noisy ( \u03c41Bis small).6\nRegulations Regulators often impose constraints on the use of group memb ership in lending decisions. For\ninstance it is illegal in the U.S. to make lending decisions b ased on race or gender. We can capture this idea by\nassuming that regulations prevent lenders from conditioni ngexplicitly onz", "article_title": "w26330", "full_section_title": "", "block_type": "text", "language": "en", "last_edit_date": "2024-01-01", "num_tokens": 444}

We can think of this signal as coming from non-standard data\nsources, such as social media footprint or internet browsin g history. The key point is that new data sources are\nless likely to favor the majority. Everyone has a browsing hi story and almost everyone is on social media, or at\nleast there is no reason to believe that minorities are less l ikely to be on social media than the majority. I will thus\nassume that \u03c42B=\u03c42A.\n6I consider for simplicity the case of risk neutral lenders bu t it is worth pointing out that the results only get stronger i f lenders are risk\naverse.

Even if there is prejudice, its impact is small if \u03c42is large because the\nBayesian part of the mechanism carries more weight.\nProposition 5. Biased multivariate Fintech lending can decrease the welfar e of the minority, but this becomes\nincreasingly less likely as Fintech algorithms become more p recise.\nThere are two keys lessons here. The \ufb01rst lesson is that for Fi ntech to hurt the minority two issues must interact:\n(i) BDML needs to build a direct proxy for group membership; a nd (ii) the algorithm itself must contain prejudice.\nIf only one issue is present, Fintech improves welfare for th e minority. It is only in the biased multivariate case that\nFintech can be detrimental. The second lesson is that even in the pessimistic case, when Fintech lending becomes\nprecise enough it always improves welfare for the minority. Even when engineers su\ufb00er from prejudice and somehow\nembed this prejudice into their algorithms, the prejudice d ecreases with the precision of the credit scoring model.\n164 Conclusion\nFintech is likely to decrease the costs of \ufb01nancial intermed iation, but also to create new regulatory issues. In this\nshort note I have highlighted two relevant forces that will s hape the impact of Fintech on inequality.

In the credit market, I have argued\nthat alternate data sources are likely to reduce non-statis tical discrimination. To the extent that minorities were\nhurt by prejudice or negative stereotyping, alternate data sources will have a positive impact. On the other hand\nnew data can reduce the e\ufb00ectiveness of existing regulation s.\n17References\nAbraham, F., S. L. Schmukler, and J. Tessada (2019). Robo-ad visors: Investing through machines.
