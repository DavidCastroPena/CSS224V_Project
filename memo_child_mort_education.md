|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Reducing Child Mortality in the Last Mile: Experimental Evidence on Community H... | Uganda |  | Child mortality was measured by surveying approximately 7,000 households, including more than 11,000 children, three years after the program's implementation. Education and awareness were assessed through household surveys measuring knowledge of disease transmission (e.g., diarrhea, malaria) and effective treatments (e.g., zinc for diarrhea). Health-promoting behaviors (e.g., water treatment, bed net use) were also self-reported. | Poisson empirical model | Governments and NGOs should continue investing in facility-based health care and integrating CHW programs into existing strategies. Adding incentives to existing volunteer-based delivery systems can potentially improve the cost-effectiveness of life-saving programs. |
| Revising Infant Mortality Rates for the Early 20th Century United States | United States | March 2017 | Infant mortality rates (IMR) are computed by dividing registered deaths of infants by the number of registered live births occurring during a calendar year. The paper revised the number of births using newly released decennial census microdata, leaving the published counts of infant deaths unchanged. Education and awareness are not directly defined or measured in this analysis. | The paper used regression analysis to determine the ability of state fixed effects and state-specific linear time trends to explain the gap between published and adjusted infant mortality estimates. An Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition was used to analyze the black-white IMR gap using socioeconomic status measures. | The paper does not offer explicit policy recommendations, but highlights the importance of accurate vital statistics for targeting, executing, and evaluating public health interventions. The findings suggest that previous research using published vital statistics may be biased due to underregistration of births. |
| Does Head Start Improve Children’s Life Chances? Evidence from a Regression Discontinuity Design | the 300 poorest counties in the U.S. | October, 2005 | Child mortality was measured using county-level data from the Vital Statistics Compressed Mortality Files (CMF) for 1973-83, focusing on deaths of children ages 5-9 from causes directly or indirectly addressed by Head Start's health services. Education was measured using data from the 1990 Census and the National Education Longitudinal Study (NELS), focusing on high school completion, college attendance, and years of schooling. The paper does not explicitly define or measure awareness. | Regression discontinuity (RD) design was used to analyze the relationship between child mortality, education, and Head Start funding. Both parametric (using polynomial functions of 1960 county poverty rates) and non-parametric (using locally linear regressions with kernel weights) methods were employed. | The findings suggest that Head Start yields net benefits, particularly for the poorest children. The non-educational components of Head Start may contribute significantly to its benefits. Further research is needed to determine the generalizability of these findings to more recent cohorts and different populations. |
| EFFECT OF A MICRO ENTREPRENEUR-BASED COMMUNITY HEALTH DELIVERY PROGRAM ON UNDER-FIVE MORTALITY IN UGANDA: A CLUSTER-RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL | Uganda | September, 2016 | Child mortality was measured as all-cause under-five mortality (U5MR), infant mortality rate (IMR), and neonatal mortality rate (NMR), calculated using household survey data. Education and awareness were assessed through household surveys measuring health knowledge (e.g., knowledge of disease transmission, treatment efficacy), preventive behaviors (e.g., water treatment, bed net use), and treatment of illnesses (e.g., malaria, diarrhea). | A cluster-randomized controlled trial was used. Intention-to-treat analyses compared intervention and control clusters using Poisson models (for mortality rates) and risk ratios (for behavioral outcomes), adjusting for stratified randomization and clustering standard errors at the cluster level. Marginal standardization and the delta method were used to derive rate ratios and confidence intervals for mortality rates. | The findings suggest that incentivized community health worker programs, like the CHP program, can significantly reduce child mortality. The authors recommend continued improvement of facility-based professional healthcare and integration of similar programs into existing health service provision strategies. |
| Black Tax: Evidence of Racial Discrimination in Municipal Borrowing Costs | United States | November, 2022 |  |  |  |
| Do Girls Pay the Price of Civil War? Violence and Infant Mortality in Congo | Democratic Republic of Congo | March 2015 | Child mortality was defined as mortality of children by 12 months of age. Education was measured using the mother's education level (no education, primary, secondary). The paper does not explicitly define or measure awareness. | Instrumental variable approach, ordinary least squares (OLS) regressions, mother fixed effects regressions. | Policies aiming at enhancing the resilience of (pregnant) women to violent experiences, such as multiple micronutrient supplementation, nutrition-sensitive programs, family planning, and educational interventions to increase spacing between births. |
| Accounting for the Widening Mortality Gap between American Adults with and without a BA | United States | Fall, 2023 | The paper focuses on adult mortality, not child mortality. Education was defined as having or not having a four-year college degree (BA). Awareness is not explicitly defined or measured. | Standard life table methods were used to calculate life expectancy at age 25 (e25) and expected years of life between ages 25 and 85 (60e25). Age-adjusted mortality rates were computed from age 25 to 84. A variant of the cause deletion method was used to analyze the contributions of different causes of death to the widening mortality gap. | The paper suggests policies to address the widening mortality gap, such as addressing the challenges facing children who have lost parents to drugs, alcohol, and suicide, and encouraging college attendance. It also mentions the need for broader social and economic changes. |


### Detailed Findings from Individual Papers

* **"Reducing Child Mortality in the Last Mile: Experimental Evidence on Community H..."**:  This study from Uganda found that incentivizing community health workers led to a significant reduction in child mortality. The cost-effectiveness of this entrepreneurial model was comparable to, or even better than, other volunteer-based programs.  The incentivized approach encouraged more regular household visits and improved health practices.

* **"Revising Infant Mortality Rates for the Early 20th Century United States"**: This paper revised historical infant mortality rates in the US, finding that previous data overestimated Black infant mortality due to underregistration of births.  This highlights the importance of accurate data for effective policymaking.

* **"Does Head Start Improve Children’s Life Chances? Evidence from a Regression Discontinuity Design"**: Focusing on the poorest US counties, this study found that Head Start had positive long-term impacts on both health and education, especially for Black children.  The non-educational components, including health services, contributed significantly to these benefits.

* **"EFFECT OF A MICRO ENTREPRENEUR-BASED COMMUNITY HEALTH DELIVERY PROGRAM ON UNDER-FIVE MORTALITY IN UGANDA: A CLUSTER-RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL"**: This Ugandan study demonstrated a substantial reduction in under-five mortality through an incentivized community health worker program.  The entrepreneurial model, where workers earned income by selling health products, proved highly effective.

* **"Black Tax: Evidence of Racial Discrimination in Municipal Borrowing Costs"**: This research found that municipalities with higher Black populations face higher borrowing costs, impacting their ability to fund essential services, which could indirectly affect child mortality.

* **"Do Girls Pay the Price of Civil War? Violence and Infant Mortality in Congo"**: This study revealed that girls are disproportionately affected by conflict-related infant mortality in the Democratic Republic of Congo.  This highlights the need for targeted interventions to protect vulnerable populations during conflict.

* **"Accounting for the Widening Mortality Gap between American Adults with and without a BA"**: While focused on adult mortality, this research underscores the importance of education in health outcomes.  Addressing the root causes of mortality disparities, including educational attainment, could have long-term benefits for child health.


### Policy Recommendations

Based on the research summarized above, the following policy recommendations are suggested:

* **Invest in Community Health Worker Programs:** Implement or expand community health worker programs, particularly those incorporating an incentivized model.  This can improve access to healthcare and health education in underserved communities.
* **Ensure Accurate Data Collection:** Prioritize accurate and comprehensive data collection on births and child mortality to effectively target interventions and evaluate program success.
* **Support Early Childhood Education Programs:** Invest in programs like Head Start, which provide comprehensive services, including health and education, to young children, particularly in low-income communities.
* **Address Social Determinants of Health:** Consider policies that address broader social and economic factors that contribute to health disparities, such as poverty, access to education, and racial discrimination.
* **Targeted Interventions for Vulnerable Populations:** Develop targeted interventions to protect vulnerable populations, such as girls in conflict zones, and address the specific health challenges they face.


By implementing these recommendations, your county can take significant steps towards reducing child mortality through education and awareness initiatives.  Further research tailored to the specific context of your county is recommended to refine these recommendations and ensure their effectiveness.
