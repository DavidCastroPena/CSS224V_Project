Public participation is a cornerstone of the San Francisco planning process. Typically, all residents and owners of properties located within 150 feet of a proposed development and all registered neighborhood groups are notified of upcoming public meetings. In the case of large projects, developers are expected to meet with the local community prior to submitting a preliminary project assessment application, and once this has been reviewed by the City, they are expected to attend one or more public meetings. Based on San Francisco's Inclusionary Housing Program, developers of projects with ten or more residential units are required to sell or rent a percentage of the units below market, a rate that is affordable to low and/or middle-income households (or pay an Affordable Housing Fee in lieu).\n\nWe review videos of Planning Commission meetings between 2018 and 2019 in the San Francisco City Hall in which housing development proposals were considered, and verbal input from members of the public was received.
