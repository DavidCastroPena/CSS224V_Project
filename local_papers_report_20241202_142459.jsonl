Just as not everyone \nwho has access to spinach at the supermarket eats spinach, so, too, not \neveryone who has access to banking services opens a bank account.\nResponding to the discussion, Leora Klapper answered Romer\u2019s ques-\ntion by saying that she and her coauthor were interested not in the quan-tity of saving as such but in the behavioral decision to save: what people \ndid with the money that they were deliberately putting aside for a specific \npurpose, such as for a large purchase or for retirement. What the authors \nfound was that these savings were typically placed in informal ROSCAs \n(rotating savings and credit associations) or under the mattress. Since the \nformer are plagued by fraud and the latter is extremely unsafe, it seemed to the authors natural to suppose that a formal bank account, or at least \na lockbox at a bank, was a better place to hold that money. Klapper also \nnoted that in some countries such as Bangladesh, microfinance institu-\ntions are important sources of formal savings and credit, used by many \npeople who do not have bank accounts", "Similarity Score": 0.7357460856437683}

This shift not only enhanced women's familiarity and comfort with mobile money but\nalso empowered them by providing a private and secure platform to manage their funds, thereby enabling greater financial\ncontrol and decision-making within their households [23],\u00a0. The promotion of savings among vulnerable women in Kenya through\nmobile banking increased individual financial security but led to a reduction in informal sharing of financial burden arrangements\nwithin communities, potentially leaving vulnerable populations more exposed to shocks. While savings initiatives can positively\nimpact welfare, policymakers should carefully consider their interaction with existing informal systems to ensure comprehensive\nrisk management strategies for women in low- and middle-income countries [20]. Policymakers must prioritize promoting digital\nfinancial services for women's empowerment, while ensuring interventions address barriers and unintended consequences to\nfoster comprehensive financial inclusion strategies.Mobile instant credit can improve resilience, subjective well-being, and investments in education of consumers.\nHowever, it is important to acknowledge the potential risks to borrowers.

For most people a formal account serves \nas an entry point into the formal financial sector. Having a formal account \nfacilitates the transfer of wages, remittances, and government payments. It \ncan also encourage formal saving and open access to credit.

Kohn asked whether the \nauthors had investigated whether the newly banked individuals in their \nsamples actually understood what they were getting, particularly on the \ncredit side, and whether their findings pointed to any measures that could \nbe taken to improve their understanding.\nDavid Romer, also following up on Carroll\u2019s comment, cited some \nspecific findings in the paper that could be interpreted as rational behavior \non the part of the nonincluded. For example, the paper reported that a large \nfraction of the nonincluded chose not to have a bank account because they \nhad too little money to make it worthwhile. That seemed to Romer a plau-\nsibly rational response. Others said that they had a relative with a bank account, so that in effect they did have access to financial services even \nthough they were counted as excluded.

It is highly unlikely, as the policy was announced in 2005 without prior notice.\n11The total number of districts in 2001 was 593. For districts that were split from a 2001 district, we\nrecoded them to the original district. Some districts were excluded because they were formed after 2001 by\nmerging several existing districts, making it impossible to map them to previous districts. After a careful\nreview of RBI documents and historical texts, we further excluded three districts due to suspected coding\nerrors or manipulation. Ujjain, a historically wealthy city not initially included in the list of under-banked\ndistricts in 2005, was added in 2006. We suspect this addition might have been politically motivated, and\nhence, we excluded Ujjain. Badgam district was also removed from our sample. There was a transfer of\nlead bank responsibility in respect of Anantnag, Budgam, Pulwama and Srinagar districts to the Jammu &\nKashmir Bank Ltd. up to March 2005. These bank branches were recorded as closed in the RBI bank branch\ndata, reversing the treatment status of Badgam. Lastly, we dropped Varanasi due to the 2002 merger of the\nprivate sector Banaras State Bank with the nationalized Bank of Baroda. This merger led to some bank\nbranches in Varanasi being coded as closed, altering their treatment status.\n72", "Similarity Score": 0.7044076919555664}

World-wide, about 43 percent of account holders report having set aside money \nat a formal financial institution in the past year; the figure varies rela-\ntively little across country income groups. However, in many sub-Saharan \nAfrican countries, such as Liberia and Uganda, more than 65 percent of \naccount holders report saving formally. This suggests that in these coun-\ntries the ability to save in a secure location may motivate individuals to \nopen and maintain a formal account. In contrast, in many countries in \nCentral and Eastern Europe and Central Asia, adults do not primarily use \ntheir accounts to save: in this region fewer than one in six adults with a \nformal account report having saved or set aside money using a formal \naccount in the past year. In Georgia just 3 percent of account holders (and \n1 percent of all adults) report having saved using a formal account in the \npast year. However, adults in this region are especially likely to use their \naccounts to receive wages and government payments. This ability, rather \nthan the opportunity for saving, may thus be a key reason why these adults \nown formal accounts.\nMany adults, despite having a formal account, save solely using other \nmethods. These people, who might be classified as the \u201cunderbanked,\u201d \nconstitute 12 percent of account holders worldwide.

The first \nround, analyzed in this paper, took place in 2011, and two rounds will fol-\nlow in 2014 and 2017. The timing is particularly fortuitous: the first round \nwas collected before the mobile money \u201crevolution\u201d really took hold: the \nsurvey reveals that as of 2011, only 16 percent of African adults had ever \nused mobile money, and fewer than 5 percent of adults in all other regions \nhad.

The \nGlobal Findex data set will therefore provide a series of snapshots over \na tremendously exciting decade, during which the definition of financial \ninclusion itself may change as new tools such as mobile phone\u2013based sav-\nings accounts are further developed and adopted.

Like the authors, I am interested in understanding the determinants \nof the use of financial products, and I have gained some further insights by focusing on the cross-country behavior of variables at the macro (aggre-\ngate) level. These findings, which I will summarize here, complement the \nauthors\u2019 results.\nThe existing literature allows one to identify four categories of obstacles \nto financial inclusion at the country level, which affect either the demand \nfor or the supply of financial services or both (see Rojas-Su\u00e1rez and  \nGonzales 2010 and Rojas-Su\u00e1rez and Amado forthcoming): socioeconomic \nconstraints, macroeconomic factors, characteristics of the operations of \nthe formal financial system, and institutional deficiencies. Here I will pres-\nent and discuss some simple correlations between these obstacles and one \nof the Global Findex indicators of financial inclusion, namely, the percent-\nage of the adult population with an account at a formal institution.\nWith regard to the first category, it is generally expected that coun-\ntries that score high on indicators of social development, such as access \nto high-quality health and education services, will also enjoy high levels \nof financial inclusion. As discussed by Stijn Claessens (2005), financial \nexclusion is often part of a broader social exclusion, which is related, \namong other factors, to differences in education, type of employment, and \ntraining", "Similarity Score": 0.7023772597312927}

These \naccounts are used for a wide range of purposes including receipt of wage \npayments, government transfers, and remittances from family members \nliving elsewhere.\nAt the country level, the Global Findex data show sharp disparities in \nthe use of financial services between high-income and developing coun-\ntries, confirming the findings of previous studies that show lower use of \nformal financial services in developing countries (see, for example, Beck, \nDemirg\u00fc\u00e7-Kunt, and Martinez Peria 2007 and Cull, Demirg\u00fc\u00e7-Kunt, and \nMorduch 2013).

An estimate\nfrom the World Bank posits that approximately 1.7 billion people, primarily residing in\nunderdeveloped countries, are devoid of basic banking facilities, such as checking accounts or\nstandardsavingsproducts( Demirguc-Kuntetal. ,2018). Thissituationstarklycontrastswith\ndeveloped economies like the United States, where a mere 4.5% of households are \u201cunbanked\u201d\n(FDIC,2021). This deprivation from finance could impede economic development by curbing\naggregate investment and employment and distorting capital allocation among firms and\npotential entrepreneurs ( Hsieh and Klenow ,2009;Buera et al. ,2011;Bazzi et al. ,2021;\nFonseca and Matray ,2022).\nMany developing countries have implemented place-based policies to stimulate bank ex-\npansion in lagging regions, believing that these policies have the potential to ignite economic\ngrowth and alleviate poverty through better access to financial services. Previous literature,\nutilizing both Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs) and natural experiments, tends to high-\nlight substantial benefits to industrial growth and household well-being in areas that have\nseen an influx of banking services ( Burgess and Pande ,2005;Bruhn and Love ,2014;Young,\n2017;Cramer,2021;Fonseca and Matray ,2022;Barboni et al. ,2021)", "Similarity Score": 0.7020174264907837}

This catch-up is more evident when\nfocusing on districts around the policy cutoff, as displayed in the right panel. Under-banked\nand banked districts had remarkably similar levels of capital prior to the policy, suggesting\nthat the treatment status assignment was as good as random around the policy cutoff.

These patterns interestingly invert when examining the capital of the\naverage firm, as shown in Figure 4. The left panel indicates that before the policy, firms in\nunder-banked districts were approximately 20% largerthan firms in banked districts in terms\nof fixed assets. This pattern is consistent with our cross-sectional evidence that under-banked\ndistricts tend to have higher TFP due to the selection of more productive firms.\nThere are two potential explanations for the positive selection.

This indicates that the effects we found in the post-\nreform period are not merely a result of pre-existing trends or other factors unrelated to the\nbank expansion.\nLabor demand or labor supply? The results presented in Figure 6lend support to our\nmain hypothesis that industrial growth creates more job opportunities in non-agricultural\nsectors and thus facilitates structural transformation. However, it is important to consider\nan alternative hypothesis that bank expansion may also increase industrial labor supply.\nAssuming non-homothetic preferences, such as a subsistence consumption requirement for\nagricultural goods, workers in places with lower agricultural productivity may self-select into\nagriculture because they are poorer ( Lagakos and Waugh ,2013). Bank expansion would\nhave a stronger impact in less productive places by relaxing this subsistence requirement and\nincreasing industrial labor supply.\nTo provide additional evidence supporting our hypothesis regarding the role of labor\ndemand, we examine the heterogeneous effects of the reform. If the labor demand hypothesis\nis valid, we would expect to see a stronger effect of the reform in villages that can better\nleverage the industrial expansion. These could include villages near urban centers ( Madhok\net al.,2022), where there is higher demand for labor due to industrial growth", "Similarity Score": 0.6894580125808716}

(8)\n6.7 Dynamic Equilibrium\nAn equilibrium of this economy is one in which at each time period firms choose to take loans\nfrom their preferred bank, or not enter; firms produce optimally given their loan size; banks\nset interest rates optimally; and the number of banks at each time period obeys a zero profit\ncondition for potential entrants.\n6.8 Characteristics of Equilibrium\nBecause banks are symmetric, they each offer the same interest rate to a firm iat time t.\nThe interest rate offered at time tdepends on the firm\u2019s type probability. In turn the firm\u2019s\nloan size depends on \u03c3i, the offered interest rate, and the prevailing wage and rental rate of\ncapital.\nEquation 7shows that bank profits depend on market size, \u2126t, and the distribution of\n\u03c3,F\u03c3,t. For entrants, profits also depend on the entry cost, \u03b4. From Equations 5and6,\nprofits also depend on the number of other banks in the market. Since banks are symmetric,\nthe number of banks determines the degree of competition in the banking sector. When the\nnumber of banks is small, banks\u2019 pricing decisions have equilibrium effects on total market\nsize, resulting in higher interest rates. As the number of banks increases interest rates fall.\nIn turn firms that face lower interest rates take out bigger loans, which increases their labor\ninputs, capital inputs, output, and revenue.\n306", "Similarity Score": 0.5927547216415405}
