Financial inclusion aims to \nreduce such risks, and provide safer options to them, but over the years the various policies adopted \nby the government to increase the presence of banks in remote rural areas have still not been able to \ncover the majo rity of the population. Those who have been provided with no -frills bank accounts lack \nthe incentive to utilize these accounts to save money. Most of the strategies of the government in \npromoting financial inclusion have been centred on the provision of ba nk accounts in order to \nfacilitate credit to the poor. The provision of credit, though important, is not the only means through \nwhich the poor can be included in the economy through financial services.  \nUnderstanding how the poor earn and manage their mone y can help in designing better instruments \nand institutions to address their financial needs. In Portfolios of the Poor , Collins et al. (2009) aim to do \nthis through the use of \u2018financial diaries\u2019.  The authors interviewed poor households in Bangladesh, \nIndia, and South Africa twice a month for a year, asking a series of questions which were then \nconstructed into \u2018financial diaries\u2019 to understand how the poor spent their money",
