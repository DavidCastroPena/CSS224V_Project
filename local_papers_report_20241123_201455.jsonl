The discontinuity for mortality from all causes for children \n5-9 is usually negative and just slightly larger in absolute value than deaths from Head Start \nsusceptible causes, but is much less precisely estimated. \nOne question is whether impacts of this proportional magnitude are plausible.  For all \ncounties in the U.S. from 1973-83 the mean and median mortality rate for children 5-9 from \nHead Start susceptible causes equaled around 2.0 and 1.8 per 100,000, respectively.

Put differently, a 50-100% increase in Head Start funding leads to a 33-75% \ndecline in mortality rates from relevant causes.  This impact seems plausible given that poverty is \na powerful risk factor for child health (Sing and Yu, 1996, Case, Lubotsky and Paxson, 2002). \nSome support for the idea that these mortality differences are due to Head Start rather \nthan other factors comes from the fact that we do not observe a similar discontinuity in mortality \nrates for children 5-9 from causes that should not be affected by Head Start \u2013 namely, injuries \n(second panel, Table 3).23  Although we might expect Head Start enrollment to affect \ncontemporaneous injury rate (see for example Currie and Hotz, 2004), we do not expect the \nprogram to affect accident rates for children ages 5-9", "Similarity Score": 0.7730712890625}

Conclusions \nOne contribution of our paper is to highlight a new source of identifying information for \nthe long-term effects of Head Start, generated by the discontinuity in program funding across \ncounties by virtue of the grant-writing assistance given in 1965 to just the poorest 300 counties.  \nWe also demonstrate that the discontinuity in Head Start funding at the OEO cutoff is mirrored \nby a large discontinuity in child mortality rates for causes of death plausibly affected by Head \nStart.  The impacts are proportionately large among both blacks and whites, although imprecisely \nestimated for blacks.  There are no significant discontinuities in either other causes of death or \nage groups that should not be affected by Head Start. \n Our evidence for positive Head Start impacts on educational attainment is suggestive, \nalthough neither of the data sources available to us is quite ideal.  We show that there are \nstatistically significant positive discontinuities in high school completion and college attendance \nin the 1990 Census, concentrated among cohorts exposed to Head Start", "Similarity Score": 0.7648573517799377}

The restricted version of the Panel Study of Income \nDynamics provides annual geo-coded addresses but since the PSID has a national sampling frame \nthe data winds up providing a very small and unrepresentative draw of people in counties near \nthe OEO cutoff.  The result is that we cannot detect a discontinuity in Head Start participation \namong the small number of PSID respondents who live in counties near the OEO cutoff, \nalthough we do use broader samples from the PSID below for descriptive mobility calculations.11 \nIV. Empirical Strategy \n The heart of our research design is to examine whether discontinuities in Head Start \nfunding at the OEO cutoff are mirrored by discontinuities in other outcomes.  Our analyses are \nconducted using county-level data, the level at which our Census and mortality data are reported. \nWe aggregate the NELS to the county level as well, the simplest way to account within our semi-\nparametric framework for the fact that students within counties are not independent units.12   \nLet Yc represent some average outcome for residents of county (c), such as child mortality \nrate, let Pc represent each county\u2019s poverty rate in 1960, and let the index (c) be defined over \ncounties sorted in descending order by their 1960 poverty rate (so that c=1 is the poorest county \nand the OEO cutoff occurs at c=300).

More worrisome is the possibility of non-random migration, \nwhich is not a real concern with our mortality results (given we measure outcomes at ages 5-9, \njust a few years after Head Start participation) although may be more of a problem with our \nschooling estimates.  But there are a few reasons to believe that our schooling estimates are not \nsimply artifacts of selective migration across counties. \nOne data point against the selective-migration hypothesis comes from the qualitative \nsimilarity in results between the 1990 Census, which assigns people to treatment and control \ncounties based on county of residence during adulthood, and the NELS, which assigns people to \ncounties based on where they live at age 13.  Migration across poor counties between ages 3-4 \nand age 13 appears to be modest at least according to the PSID, which provides small and \nunrepresentative samples \u201cclose\u201d to the OEO cutoff but at least lets us compare people in all 300 \npoorest counties with the next 300 poorest counties.  Of the respondents in the 300 poorest \ncounties at age 3, fully 86% were in one of these counties at age 13; of those in one of these \ncounties at age 13, 64% were in one at age 3.  Importantly, the results are similar for PSID \nrespondents in the next 300 poorest counties, and if anything slightly more low-education people \nare leaving the \u201ccontrol\u201d than \u201ctreatment\u201d counties", "Similarity Score": 0.7594414353370667}

Results for Head Start Funding and Participation \n What effect did OEO\u2019s Head Start grant-writing assistance to the 300 poorest counties \nhave on Head Start funding?   Historical documents note that 240 (80%) of these 300 counties \nreceived Head Start funding (GAO, 1981), compared to 43% of all counties nationwide \n(estimated from our 1968 federal expenditure data).  Data from the NELS and for county-level \nfederal expenditures are consistent with these historical accounts. \n Table 1 shows that for the 349 \u201ccontrol\u201d counties with 1960 poverty rates that are within \n10 percentage points of the OEO cutoff from below (49.198 to 59.198), average Head Start \nspending per 4 year old in 1968 was equal to $134 (in 1968 dollars).  For the 228 \u201ctreatment\u201d \ncounties with 1960 poverty rates 10 percentage points above the OEO cutoff this figure is $288 \nper 4 year old, more than twice as much.  In 1972 Head Start spending per 4 year-old is still \nnearly 60% higher in the treatment than control counties. \n In Figure 1 we show that the difference shown in Table 1 in Head Start funding around \nthe OEO cutoff is driven in large part by a sharp drop-off in spending at the cutoff itself", "Similarity Score": 0.7391401529312134}

Indonesian children normally attend primary school between the age of\n7 and 12. A child born in 1962 or before was 12 or older in 19 74, when the \ufb01rst schools\nwere constructed, and therefore would get only a minimal exposure to the program (less\nthan 3% of children born between 1950 and 1962 were still in primary school in 1974).\nAs we explained above, the district of birth is a second dimension of variation in the\nintensity of the program: children born in a region where the enrollment rates in 1972\nwere low are very likely to be educated in this region, and thus to be exposed to a high\nprogram intensity. Based on this observation, Du\ufb02o (2001) proposed to use the interaction\nbetween an individual\u2019s cohort and the number of school built in his region of birth to\nevaluate the impact of the program", "Similarity Score": 0.7388181090354919}

Introduction \n \nThis paper provides new evidence on the effects of the Head Start program on schooling \nand health by drawing on a new source of variation in program funding.  We exploit a \ndiscontinuity in program funding across counties that resulted from how the Office of Economic \nOpportunity (OEO) launched the program during the spring of 1965 as part of the War on \nPoverty.  Head Start was established to provide preschool, health and other social services to \npoor children ages 3 or 4.  It represents one of the federal government\u2019s primary means for \naddressing the large disparities in cognitive and non-cognitive skills observed along race and \nclass lines well before children start school.1  Head Start currently serves over 800,000 children \neach year at a cost of around $7 billion (Haskins, 2004). \nEarly childhood may represent a particularly promising target for human capital \ninterventions given evidence that neurodevelopmental plasticity may decline with age, together \nwith the possibility of dynamic complementarities in learning (Duncan et al., 1998, Shonkoff and \nPhillips, 2000, Carniero and Heckman, 2003).  \u201cTwo generation\u201d programs like Head Start, \nwhich target parents as well as children, could also change the stream of human capital \ninvestments that parents make in their children over the life course", "Similarity Score": 0.7365968227386475}

{"Source": "papers/ImprovingOutcomesforYoungChildren.pdf", "Content": ". While a dual generation approach could be relevant for any family, the theory was designed for contexts of adversity, as these contexts are least served by traditional intervention. Vulnerable children might not benefit from direct intervention as much or at all if their broader context is not addressed, and the limited effects of existing interventions were partly what inspired dual generation approaches. As articulated by Shonkoff, \u201cachieving breakthrough outcomes for young children facing adversity requires supporting the adults who care for them to transform their own lives.\u201d37  Dual generation theory originated in the United States and certain details of its conceptualization might not transfer to other settings. For example, an emphasis on postsecondary educational opportunities or employment or livelihoods programs for parents, might not transfer to all contexts of forced displacement, but applying the core tenet of dual generation theory to such contexts holds great promise. Given the challenges facing children in contexts of forced displacement, and particularly the challenges facing children of adolescents, the applications of dual generation theory for child development may be one of the most potentially powerful.  Of existing humanitarian interventions, parenting programs are one of the most appropriate targets for a dual generation lens: they are already focused on early childhood development outcomes and include both the parent and the child", "Similarity Score": 0.7313589453697205}

There is currently no review that focuses on programs that target under -five \nchild health. Here, we review process evaluation s and other studies on existing cash transfer programs \nin India. This adds to the descriptive knowledge base, elucidating specific design and implementation \nfeatures that promote or hinder the success of cash transfer programs.  \nScope and Approach  \nTo understand t he design and implementation features that promote or hinder the success of cash \ntransfer programs, we undertook several activities. We first mapped the landscape of cash transfer \nprograms in India that target under -five child health and identified 30 prog rams in which either the \ntransfer or the condition directly or indirectly targeted under -five child health. These programs \nincluded a combination of maternity benefit programs and girl child protection programs. The short -\nlisted programs formed the basis o f our desk review. We subsequently conducted a literature review \nand synthesized a broad range of evidence comprising of process evaluations, peer -reviewed articles, \nworking papers, other observational studies. Our review comprised of 20 studies across 7 p rograms \nthat were available in the public domain", "Similarity Score": 0.7300733923912048}

Geographic\ninequality plays a larger role in the perpetuation of child mortality risk across generations.\nIn studying child loss across generations, we contribute to a new demographic literature\nthat shifts attention from deceased individuals to their survivors. Bereaved individuals face\nphysical and mental health risks (Stroebe et al., 2007), and unequal distributions of mortality\nimply unequal distributions of bereavement. The cumulative toll of maternal bereavement\nis large; in some African countries, a majority of middle-aged women have experienced the\ndeath of at least one child under 5 (Smith-Greenaway and Trinitapoli, 2020; Alburez-Gutierrez\n16et al., 2021; Smith-Greenaway et al., 2021). The unequal burden of bereavement may be an\nimportant source of inequality in wellbeing, especially when it involves parental loss of a child\n(Li et al., 2003, 2005; Rogers et al., 2008).\nThe excess risk of child death among women who were bereaved of their siblings dissipates\nas child mortality falls in aggregate, suggesting a new way to think about the distribution of\nmortality decline. In absolute terms, high-mortality lineages bene\ufb01ted more from mortality\ndecline. This result may be speci\ufb01c to the unprecedented, broad-based improvements in child\nhealth that many developing countries experienced in the late 20thand early 21stcenturies.

Qualitative research into differences across implementation in Ugandan and Tanzanian contexts suggests that resource and funding constraints in the Tanzanian context significantly hindered implementation there.61 The literature on ELA clubs draws attention to a number of key concerns, from the importance of implementation fidelity to the challenges of transferring across contexts. Given the constraints  15 Innovations for Poverty Action | poverty-action.org and limited resources that often define contexts of forced displacement, these concerns are highly relevant. This literature demonstrates that it is possible to improve outcomes for adolescents. However, these interventions aim to prevent adolescent pregnancy (among other outcomes), rather than work to support those who are already pregnant or parents. While there are interventions and programmatic approaches for working with adolescent parents, they are most prevalent in the United States, with far fewer international examples. Even in the United States, where these programs are more common, rigorous evaluation of programs is notably lacking and there is a clear need for high quality research into the effectiveness of these interventions.62  It is also important to recognize that existing services for mothers and parents might not be able to meet the unique needs of young caregivers", "Similarity Score": 0.7285614609718323}

Supporting caregivers and their relationships with children can be an important strategy for improving early childhood development in contexts of forced displacement.  Parenting programs \u2013 interventions that aim to improve early childhood development outcomes through building parenting skills and knowledge and improving parent-child interactions \u2013 are one of the few interventions to consider both children and caregivers together.2 Across different low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), various parenting programs have been found to positively affect young children\u2019s development, as well as parenting practices and knowledge.3 However, parenting programs rarely focus on independent, non-parental outcomes for caregivers.  These interventions thus present a unique opportunity to apply a dual generation approach, where programs can be adapted to address their overall skills, knowledge, needs, and wellbeing, in addition to their parenting skills and knowledge. In this evidence synthesis, we aim to generate actionable insight for policy and practice in improving outcomes for forcibly displaced children aged 0-3 and their caregivers. We review relevant literature, theory, and implementation materials across multiple fields of research and intervention. In particular, we explore how dual-generation theory can be applied to early childhood development in contexts of forced displacement.

Unfortunately, many of the factors which have been found to promote positive outcomes for adolescent parents and their children are exactly the factors most threatened by experiences of displacement: access to stable housing and income generating opportunities,19 as well as support from grandparents.20 Other factors, though, might be possible to encourage even in humanitarian settings, such as promoting natural mentors, educational aspirations, and ambitions.21 Interestingly, these factors seem to address parents\u2019 internal concerns, rather than their setting, suggesting that there might be ways to support adolescent caregivers beyond addressing the external context of poverty.  In targeting outcomes and designing programs for adolescent parents, it is also important to consider the legal context for young mothers.

In addition, it can build on recent advances in research on adolescence and growing recognition that this can be an important point for intervention, as the period of adolescence might present possibilities for recovery from early-life adversity.24  As described in new work by Weurmli, Yoshikawa, and Hastings (2021)25 viewing adolescent pregnancy through a dual-generational lens, in which outcomes for both parents and their children are considered, could be one of the most powerful applications of dual generation theory as it presents the opportunity to capitalize on two of the most sensitive periods of human development: early childhood and adolescence", "Similarity Score": 0.7276265025138855}

Consequently, the three  evaluations in our \nevidence base that do speak of child mortality are of large -scale national P4P programs. \nOlken, Onishi, and Wong (2014) report a 0.01 reduction of neonatal mortality  after 18 \nmonths due to the fixed block grants compared to no bonuses b ut not the incentivized \nbonuses. After 30 months, this effect disappears and neonatal mortality in incentivized \nvillages is actually 1.6 percentage points higher than in the non -incentivized villages.

Figure 1: A Dual Generation Approach to Parenting Programs in International Contexts  One key challenge for designing interventions with a dual generation framework is that they can span multiple sectors and thus might be difficult to implement. This is especially true in humanitarian settings, where sectors are known to be strictly siloed.38 Integrating a nutrition intervention into a parenting program might be prevented by restrictions around which actors can distribute food and certain resources in refugee camps. This is a broader challenge for the field of early childhood development, though, and is not unique to a two-generation approach.  Still, there are many possibilities for expanding the scope of parenting interventions while operating within the delivery structure and format of existing programs and without having to confront more of the entrenched dynamics of systems and sectors", "Similarity Score": 0.7239877581596375}

Recent systematic reviews have highlighted effects on sexual and reproductive health,54 health and life skills,55 and violence against girls.56 Key findings from these reviews suggest possible opportunities for intervention with adolescent parents in humanitarian settings, as well as potential challenges.  The review of sexual and reproductive health interventions found that effective interventions tended to be delivered through groups of similar-age peers.57 This might suggest that in parenting programs it would be helpful for adolescent parents to interact with other adolescent parents, rather than be part of general parenting groups for all ages.

This evidence synthesis provides actionable insights into policy and practice to improve outcomes for forcibly displaced children aged 0-3 and their caregivers. We review the literature on parenting programs, interventions that aim to improve early childhood development outcomes by building parenting skills and knowledge and improving parent-child interactions. We also use dual generation theory to explore how such programs could be enhanced by considering other outcomes for caregivers beyond parenting and the unique situation of adolescent caregivers. Parenting programs in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) can significantly improve outcomes for children aged 0-3, especially if explicit content on responsive care is included. 01 02 03 04 05 Rigorous research to understand the impact of parenting programs on adult outcomes outside parenting is limited.

Thus, the estimates reported in\nthis paper con\ufb01rm the \ufb01ndings of the earlier literature, that parental education has a\nstrong causal e\ufb00ect on the reduction of child mortality.\nThe results on the di\ufb00erence between the e\ufb00ect of male and female education are\nmore nuanced. Female education seems indeed to matter more than male education in\ndetermining age at marriage and number of children born before the woman reaches 15 or\n25. On the other hands, these estimates do not con\ufb01rm the intuition derived from OLS\nspeci\ufb01cations (including the OLS speci\ufb01cation in this paper) that female education has\na stronger causal impact on child mortality than male education.

{"Source": "papers/ImprovingOutcomesforYoungChildren.pdf", "Content": ". Research in Mexico found that a group-based parenting education program, while effective overall, did not improve outcomes for the children of women who began childbearing when they were adolescents.63 The researchers recognized that little is known about how to improve parenting behaviors and development outcomes for adolescent parents,64 and hypothesized that general parenting programs might not adequately or effectively address the unique needs of young mothers. They highlight the need for research to focus on this specific population and to investigate drivers of effectiveness and why there might be differential effects. A good example, and one of the only studies to evaluate a program focused on adolescents is from Chile, where researchers evaluated the effects of home visits from a paraprofessional to adolescent mothers.65 While they found positive initial effects, these faded out in the medium term, suggesting the importance of regular visits to prevent fadeout.  Conclusion Forcibly displaced children ages 0-3 and adolescent caregivers are among the world\u2019s most vulnerable, underserved, and under researched populations of children and caregivers.

Promising research from contexts of forced displacement and post-conflict LMICS suggests that parenting programs can directly target the well-being of caregivers and lead to improved outcomes for both caregivers and their children. Parental mental health and wellbeing can buffer a child from experiencing the worst effects of exposure to conflict and displacement.47 Beginning in utero, maternal stress and depression can significantly affect key domains of child development such as growth, nutrition, socio-emotional and cognitive development.48 Maintaining or improving maternal wellbeing is a key pathway to promoting nurturing care and holistic early childhood development and is a prime example of a two-generation approach to early childhood development.  Research has shown that it is possible to improve maternal wellbeing outcomes through early childhood development programming; many programs have had significant positive impacts on maternal wellbeing and mental health. A review of various interventions, encompassing more than parenting programs and for a broader set of children\u2019s ages, in LMICs identified 55 studies that reported outcomes related to maternal mental health, 27 of which reported positive statistically significant impacts", "Similarity Score": 0.70419842004776}

With this synthesis we hope to draw attention to these critical concerns and to provide evidence-based recommendations to inspire future work.  Age as a Key Source of Vulnerability CHILDREN 0-3 YEARS OF AGE AND ADOLESCENT PARENTS  Across contexts, there are parents and children who face unique challenges and whose needs or situation may be overlooked by existing programming. In settings of forced displacement, children ages 0-3 are one of the most overlooked,4 underserved,5 and under-researched 6 populations. At the same time, evidence from neuroscience indicates that intervention is urgently needed for children who experience extreme adversity and toxic stress in their earliest years.   The longer it takes to address threats to children\u2019s development in their earliest years, the more difficult it is for those children to achieve positive developmental outcomes and lifelong success.  The age of caregivers is also an important factor influencing children\u2019s development. Research has highlighted how the children of young caregivers, and young mothers in particular, often experience adverse developmental outcomes.7   Recognized as the transition between childhood and adulthood, the World Health Organization (WHO) defines adolescence as the period between 10 and 19 years of age8", "Similarity Score": 0.7034422755241394}

Also, p roviders are often overburdened with patient care and paperwork, which can \nlimit the qua ntity of care they give.  Yet at the same time, high absentee rates are common. \nIn India, for example, high absentee rates among health workers is compounded by \nsubstandard clinical practice (Chaudhury et al. 2006; Das et al. 2016). To address this, \npolicym akers have increasingly turned to pay -for-performance (P4P) \u2014incentive schemes \nthat directly reward providers for achieving certain standards of performance. \nGovernments in low- and middle -income countries  have increasingly been adopting \nperformance incenti ves in healthcare systems at multiple levels.

Only recently has there been rigorous evidence testing the impact of \nP4P on provider behaviors and, in turn, child health status.  \nThe goal of improving stagnating health outcomes has led to the growing interest in \nincentivizing health care workers. Yet several questions emerge around how best to do so. \nPolicymakers require information about how to design P4P schemes, in particular, who \nshould receive what kind of incentive , for which activities, and how often.

Even fewer reported impacts of programs on maternal mental health; only 12 percent of these randomized evaluations (RCTs) reported an impact on maternal mental health. Moreover, there is even less research regarding the impact of these programs on fathers or other male caregivers. Only 3 percent of studies included father-specific outcomes. Applying a \u2018dual generation\u2019 approach to innovation, practice, and research may determine whether building the skills and wellbeing of caregivers through parenting programs can cause breakthrough impacts for children and their caregivers. The role of fathers is critically under-studied in parenting programs. Even the intent to study fathers is sometimes not sufficient, as was the case for a study in Kenya that aimed to analyze the effects of inviting fathers to participate in a parenting program, but low attendance among fathers precluded this line of analysis.45 More work is needed to understand how to meaningfully engage fathers in parenting programs and then to assess impact. Exploring the dynamics of couples and other co-parents can also be an important area for exploration.

Approximately 12 million girls aged 15-19 and at least 777,000 girls under 15 years give birth each year in low-income countries.14 Contexts such as conflict and forced displacement increase the likelihood of girls marrying early and becoming pregnant and disrupts important sources of social support. Adolescent pregnancy has become even more common during the Covid-19 pandemic; it is estimated that 1.041 million additional girls are at risk for adolescent pregnancy. 15  Research has found that by the time a child is 4 \u00bd years old, having an adolescent mother is associated with compromised development across several domains.16 Children of adolescent mothers are also observed to have worse long-term outcomes, such as worse health, less schooling and lower earnings, and have an elevated risk of becoming adolescent parents themselves.17 Analysis of the underlying mechanisms of these associations suggests that much of the negative relationship between adolescent motherhood and child outcomes can be explained by the mothers\u2019 socioeconomic status, as the lives of adolescent parents are often defined by poverty", "Similarity Score": 0.6966589689254761}

In all of these regressions,\nwe control for interactions of wife\u2019s year of birth dummies and region of birth dummies\nwith a dummy indicating whether the husband\u2019s data was imputed.\nThe \ufb01rst two problems may a\ufb00ect the interpretation of the interactions between the\nlevel of the program and husband\u2019s and wife\u2019s year of birth, but probably not that of our\ninstrument for the di\ufb00erence in education, the interaction between husband\u2019s exposure,\n8di\ufb00erence in age between husband and wife, and the level of program. Before proceeding,\nit is nevertheless useful to think about the interpretation of this coe\ufb03cient. Since the\ninstruments are based on variables that the husband can observe (level of program and\nage di\ufb00erence), the interpretation given to the 2SLS coe\ufb03cients of women\u2019s and men\u2019s\neducation depends on the underlying model of the marriage market, and how it was\na\ufb00ected by the program", "Similarity Score": 0.6963650584220886}

In these early years, the architecture of the brain is formed, which provides a child with the life-long foundation for future learning, health, and behavior.30 In this period children are particularly sensitive to social interaction, environmental influence, and external threats to development.31 Without timely intervention, adverse threats to children\u2019s development can lead to life-long challenges related to physical and mental health, learning, behavior, and employment. Additionally, the impact of adverse childhood experiences can be cumulative; the more adverse the experiences to which a child is exposed, the greater the likelihood of long-term effects on outcomes such as substance abuse, depression, heart disease, poor academic achievement, and early death.32 In children\u2019s earliest years, responsive caregiving from parents or primary caregivers is a critical part of the nurturing care that enables children healthy developmental progression. These positive interactions can also buffer a child from the potential negative impacts of adversity and stress.33  Maternal-child attachment in particular is critical for optimal early childhood development, and in the face of adversity, maternal-child attachment and maternal psychological wellbeing are critical protective factors for children\u2019s wellbeing and development", "Similarity Score": 0.6900361776351929}

In addition, the \nprogram pays a terminal \u201cbo nus\u201d incentive to beneficiaries  provided  they meet certain conditions.  \n \nMost of  the girl child programs  provide long -term financial support to families, typically starting from \nher birth until she completes school/college.

In all but three programs, benefits are structured as progressive payments with larger  \npayments associated with reaching or completing a higher milestone. For instance, under Andhra \nPradesh\u2019s Bangaaru Tahli  program, beneficiar ies receive Rs2,000 per year while the girl is in primary \nschool, and it increases to Rs3,500 for Class XI -XII.

A \nconcern is that input incentives on a subset of tasks will concentrate effort towards those \ntasks to the detriment of the final outcome (multitasking  problem ). If tasks are substitutes \nin the production of the outcome, then incentives will tend to shift atte ntion to one task. If \ntasks are complements, then providers might be induced to perform even unincentivized \ntasks ; she engages more in the incentivized task, which raises the productivity of \nperforming the second task (by the definition of complementarity) , so she chooses to also \nengage more in the second task . One lesson from the multitasking literature is that when \nmultiple inputs contribute to a set of outcomes, outcome -based P4P allows the provider to \nuse local knowledge creatively to allocate effort ov er the different inputs to maximize \ncontracted outcomes.  For example, outreach activities and consultations may be best left \nunder the purview of providers.  14 \n The issue of multitasking also calls attention to potential unintended consequences of P4P. \nIf heal th care providers can influence outcomes by increasing quality and by manipulating \nrecords, then a P4P scheme may incentivize the latter if it is easier to misreport.

The significance of adolescence has traditionally been associated with rapid growth in physical, cognitive, and psychosocial domains as children enter puberty and often experience changes in relation to their education, work, sexual activity, identity, and relationships.9 More recently, the period of adolescence has also been recognized for its significance to the development of the brain.10 During this time, the brain\u2019s structure and function changes through the increased ability of neural networks to grow and reorganize. Moreover, during this period, adolescents are particularly prone to experience heightened levels of extreme stress and emotional reactivity.11 Theory and research in the fields of cognitive science, psychology, and neuroscience have each drawn attention to the importance of adolescence as a critical period of development.  Adolescence, accordingly, like early childhood, is a time of heightened sensitivity to environmental influence.  5 Innovations for Poverty Action | poverty-action.org This sensitivity makes adolescence both an opportunity for intervention, in that programs might be able to effect lasting change, and a point of vulnerability, as adolescents are more likely to be sensitive to stress compared to adult women and the effects of negative experiences such as stress might be similarly long-lasting", "Similarity Score": 0.653775691986084}
