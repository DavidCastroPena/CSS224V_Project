The discontinuity for mortality from all causes for children \n5-9 is usually negative and just slightly larger in absolute value than deaths from Head Start \nsusceptible causes, but is much less precisely estimated. \nOne question is whether impacts of this proportional magnitude are plausible.  For all \ncounties in the U.S. from 1973-83 the mean and median mortality rate for children 5-9 from \nHead Start susceptible causes equaled around 2.0 and 1.8 per 100,000, respectively.

Put differently, a 50-100% increase in Head Start funding leads to a 33-75% \ndecline in mortality rates from relevant causes.  This impact seems plausible given that poverty is \na powerful risk factor for child health (Sing and Yu, 1996, Case, Lubotsky and Paxson, 2002). \nSome support for the idea that these mortality differences are due to Head Start rather \nthan other factors comes from the fact that we do not observe a similar discontinuity in mortality \nrates for children 5-9 from causes that should not be affected by Head Start \u2013 namely, injuries \n(second panel, Table 3).23  Although we might expect Head Start enrollment to affect \ncontemporaneous injury rate (see for example Currie and Hotz, 2004), we do not expect the \nprogram to affect accident rates for children ages 5-9",

By the late 1990s the Head Start funding disparity across counties at \nthe OEO cutoff seems to have completely dissipated, as evidenced by the fact that we do not \nobserve a discontinuity in Head Start participation rates among children in the Early Childhood \nLongitudinal Study, Kindergarten Class of 1998-99 (ECLS-K). \nVI. Head Start and Child Mortality \nTo estimate the impact of Head Start on health, we draw on county-level data from the \nVital Statistics Compressed Mortality Files (CMF).  We identify causes-of-death that may be \naffected by Head Start through discussions with pediatricians about what health problems the \nprogram\u2019s health services should influence, which include tuberculosis, whooping cough, \ninfections, polio, measles, diabetes, malnutrition, meningitis, anemias, and respiratory problems \nsuch as asthma, bronchitis or pneumonia (a detailed list and ICD-9 codes is in Appendix A).21  \nWe label these \u201cHead Start susceptible causes\u201d or \u201crelevant causes",

It\ninstruments for con\rict intensity using a mineral price index. In other words, it\nexploits the exogenous variation in the potential value of mineral sites generated\nby changes in world mineral prices to predict the geographic distribution of the\ncon\rict. The resulting estimates con\frm the concerns expressed above. Ordi-\nnary least squares (OLS) results predict (for some speci\fcations of the model)\na decrease in mortality rates during the con\rict in the districts most heavily\na\u000bected by the violence, perhaps because the violence targets wealthier house-\nholds likely to su\u000ber lower infant mortality rates. An instrumental variables\n3analysis, however, yields the result that con\rict increases infant mortality rates,\nbut interestingly the detrimental e\u000bect seems to concentrate only among girls.\nThis \fnding is robust to many di\u000berent speci\fcations, including a very demand-\ning one that controls for mother \fxed e\u000bects. The magnitude of the e\u000bects is\nsubstantial. According to the speci\fcation controlling for mother \fxed e\u000bects\n(along with a long list of individual and climatic variables), an increase in con-\n\rict of 1 standard deviation would translate into a 9 percent increase in the\nlikelihood that a girl will die before she turns one year old",

Data \n In what follows we provide a brief overview of the county- and individual-level data \nsources used in our analysis.  More details on each dataset are in Appendix A. \n Perhaps the most important data question for our study is to understand what data source \nOEO used to identify the 300 poorest counties in the U.S. in 1960.  The answer is not \nimmediately obvious because the official federal poverty rate was only invented in 1964, and so \nthe 1960 Census does not include a measure of persons living in poverty.  OEO apparently \nidentified the poorest counties using a special 1964 re-analysis of the 1960 Census conducted by \nthe Census Bureau for OEO using the then-newly-defined federal poverty rate, a copy of which \nwe have obtained from the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA).10   \n Other county-level data for our study include an OEO file for all federal expenditures on \nevery program for the years 1968 and 1972, also obtained from NARA.
