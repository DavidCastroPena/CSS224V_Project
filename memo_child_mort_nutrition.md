**Re**: Reducing Child Mortality through Nutrition Interventions

This memo addresses your request for information on creating a nutrition-focused policy to reduce child mortality in your Mississippi county.  The following information is based on analysis of existing academic research.

**Summary of Research Findings**

| Title of Paper | Place of Study | Year | Data Sources | Econometric Methods | Policy Recommendations |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| EFFECT OF A MICRO ENTREPRENEUR-BASED COMMUNITY HEALTH DELIVERY PROGRAM ON UNDER-FIVE MORTALITY IN UGANDA: A CLUSTER-RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL | Uganda | 2016 | Cluster-randomized controlled trial, 8,119 households surveyed | Poisson model, marginal standardization technique, delta method | Integrate community health programs into existing health service provision strategies. |
| Intergenerational Child Mortality Impacts of Deworming: Experimental Evidence from Two Decades of the Kenya Life Panel Survey | Kenya | 2023 | Kenya Life Panel Survey (KLPS) | Linear probability model, logistic and probit regression | Multi-sectoral approaches and subsidies for child health investments. |
| Reducing Child Mortality in the Last Mile: Experimental Evidence on Community Health Promoters in Uganda | Uganda | 2023 | Survey of ~7,000 households, >11,000 children | Poisson empirical model | Invest in facility-based care and integrate CHW programs; consider incentives for existing volunteer systems. |
| Unconditional Cash Transfers and Maternal Assessments of Children's Health, Nutrition, and Sleep: A Randomized Clinical Trial | 4 US cities | 2023 | Annual surveys, adapted items from LA County WIC Survey, PROMIS Sleep Disturbance–Short Form | Linear regression with robust standard errors | Direct interventions connecting families with services may be more effective than cash transfers alone. |
| Does Head Start Improve Children’s Life Chances? Evidence from a Regression Discontinuity Design | 300 poorest US counties | 2005 | Vital Statistics CMF (1973-83), NELS, 1990 Census | Regression Discontinuity (RD) design, locally linear regressions | Head Start yields net benefits, especially for the poorest children; non-educational components are important. |
| Mortality and Morbidity in the 21st Century | United States | 2017 | CDC WONDER | Exploratory analysis by race, ethnicity, education, sex, trends, and international comparisons | Reduce opioid overprescription; improve safety net for mothers with children. |
| Revising Infant Mortality Rates for the Early 20th Century United States | United States | 2017 | Decennial census microdata, published infant death counts | N/A | Accurate vital statistics are crucial for targeting and evaluating public health interventions. |
| The Role of Cash Transfer in Improving Child Health: A Review of the Evidence | India | 2018 | AHS, DLHS, NFHS, administrative data from cash transfer programs | RCTs, RDD, IV, PSM, DID, pooled time-series analysis | Improve program eligibility, timely entitlements, financial inclusion, simplify conditions, and establish grievance mechanisms. |


**Study Specifics**

* **EFFECT OF A MICRO ENTREPRENEUR-BASED COMMUNITY HEALTH DELIVERY PROGRAM ON UNDER-FIVE MORTALITY IN UGANDA**: This study uniquely examines an incentivized community health worker program, finding a significant reduction in under-five mortality.
* **Intergenerational Child Mortality Impacts of Deworming**: This study uses a long-term longitudinal survey combined with experimental evidence to demonstrate the intergenerational impacts of deworming on child mortality.
* **Reducing Child Mortality in the Last Mile**: This study focuses on the impact of incentivized community health workers on various health outcomes, including child mortality, in Uganda.
* **Unconditional Cash Transfers and Maternal Assessments of Children's Health**: This US-based study found that cash transfers alone may not significantly improve all aspects of child health, suggesting the need for direct service interventions.
* **Does Head Start Improve Children’s Life Chances?**: This study uses a regression discontinuity design to evaluate the long-term impacts of Head Start, finding significant effects on mortality and schooling.
* **Mortality and Morbidity in the 21st Century**: This study provides a broad overview of mortality trends in the US, highlighting disparities and suggesting policy targets like opioid control and improved social safety nets.
* **Revising Infant Mortality Rates for the Early 20th Century United States**: This study focuses on improving the accuracy of historical infant mortality data, emphasizing the importance of reliable statistics for public health research.
* **The Role of Cash Transfer in Improving Child Health**: This study reviews the evidence on cash transfer programs in India, highlighting implementation challenges and offering policy recommendations for program improvement.


**Policy Recommendations for Mississippi**

Based on the research, consider the following policy options:

* **Community Health Worker Programs**: Implement or strengthen community health worker programs, potentially incorporating incentives to improve effectiveness.
* **Targeted Nutritional Interventions**: Implement direct interventions that connect families with nutritional services and resources.
* **Improved Data Collection**: Ensure accurate and comprehensive data collection on child mortality and nutrition to effectively target and evaluate interventions.
* **Address Social Determinants of Health**: Consider policies that address broader social determinants of health, such as poverty and access to healthcare.

Further research specific to Mississippi's context is recommended to tailor interventions and maximize impact.
