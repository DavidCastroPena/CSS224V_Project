        "ChunkText": "Figure8presents the impact of bank expansion on employment in villages with and\nwithout road connections (left panel), as well as those situated close to or far from population\ncenters with populations exceeding 10,000 (right panel). It becomes evident that villages\nconnected by roads and those closer to population centers exhibit a stronger response to\nthe bank expansion reform. In these locales, we observe a more pronounced decrease in the\nnumber of cultivators and agricultural laborers, coupled with an increase in \u2018other workers\u2019\n(including workers in both manufacturing and service sectors). These patterns suggest that\nsubsistence requirements and the labor supply channel alone are insu\ufb00icient to explain the\nstructural transformation documented in our results.\nThe regression results are reported in Table B.7andB.8. Table B.13and Table B.14\nconfirm that our estimates are similar using levels instead of logs as outcome variables.\nUsing data from the 2001 population census as a placebo test, Table B.10and Table B.11\nshow that the estimates tend to be much smaller and less statistically significant before the\npolicy implementation, thus further support our identification strategy.\n32Intriguingly, we also note a decline in \u2018other workers\u2019 and a non-significant increase in\nagricultural laborers in villages without road connections or those situated further from pop-\nulation centers. This pattern suggests a spatial reallocation of agricultural activities to places",
