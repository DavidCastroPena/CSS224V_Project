There are multiple agencies that come up with customer IDs.

Indonesia has\nmade important strides in \ufb01nancial inclusion since\nthe publication of the decree (see Section 7 below),\nthough challenges remain. In this section, we review\nthe current policy and regulatory landscape, priori-\nties, and the social context particularly as it relates\nto women\u2019s account use", "Similarity Score": 0.763608455657959}

They don't have \ntime, and we've heard this over and over again in the last 35 years of doing research on \nwomen 's lives, that they don't have time to go stand in line at a bank branch to deposit \ntheir money.  Or they're so far away from a bank branch that the money it would take to \ntake a bus to that bank ranch was actually more than they were depositing.  So digit al \nfinancial services has an incredible potential to serve women's needs for that \nconvenience.  It also helps address security.  So women, you know, as Leora was talking \nabout, carrying money around, a digital savings account can help address that security  \nissue.  \n  And confidentiality, which is so critical.  A woman wants to know that the \nmoney that she earns is safe; that she can control her own assets and not have to be \nsharing and telling her husband, her relatives, other friends in the village what she is \ndoing with her money.  And so setting up savings accounts in a digital environment I think \nare the critical product to help with financial inclusion.

This shift not only enhanced women's familiarity and comfort with mobile money but\nalso empowered them by providing a private and secure platform to manage their funds, thereby enabling greater financial\ncontrol and decision-making within their households [23],\u00a0. The promotion of savings among vulnerable women in Kenya through\nmobile banking increased individual financial security but led to a reduction in informal sharing of financial burden arrangements\nwithin communities, potentially leaving vulnerable populations more exposed to shocks. While savings initiatives can positively\nimpact welfare, policymakers should carefully consider their interaction with existing informal systems to ensure comprehensive\nrisk management strategies for women in low- and middle-income countries [20]. Policymakers must prioritize promoting digital\nfinancial services for women's empowerment, while ensuring interventions address barriers and unintended consequences to\nfoster comprehensive financial inclusion strategies.Mobile instant credit can improve resilience, subjective well-being, and investments in education of consumers.\nHowever, it is important to acknowledge the potential risks to borrowers.

For\nexample, 26 percent and 22 percent of urban and rural DFS users, respectively, reported that a\nneed to buy things online was a main trigger for DFS use. Other than that, 26 percent of urban\nrespondents also cited cheaper prices online. Overall, the majority of DFS users had purchased at\nleast some goods online since the pandemic began. The pandemic also pushed 32 percent of DFS\nusers to shop online for the \ufb01rst time.\nOur data points to emerging gender polarization in e-commerce use, with female DFS users more\nlikely to be both never and intensive e-commerce shoppers", "Similarity Score": 0.7055301070213318}

Digital financial services enhance financial inclusion by providing cost-effective, efficient, and secure access\nto financial products, bridging the gap for underserved populations. Moreover, mobilizing savings, improving resilience, providing\npathways to increase credit access, and reaching last-mile users offer opportunities to boost financial inclusion for marginalized\ngroups. The widespread availability of cell phones, even in low-income and rural areas, facilitates the adoption of services like\nmobile banking, credit, and payments. However, further research is needed to understand overborrowing, consumer protection\nrisks, bank accounts linked to formal institutions versus privately provided accounts, and women\u2019s uptake and usage", "Similarity Score": 0.6920307874679565}
