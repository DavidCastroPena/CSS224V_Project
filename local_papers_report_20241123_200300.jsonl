The discontinuity for mortality from all causes for children \n5-9 is usually negative and just slightly larger in absolute value than deaths from Head Start \nsusceptible causes, but is much less precisely estimated. \nOne question is whether impacts of this proportional magnitude are plausible.  For all \ncounties in the U.S. from 1973-83 the mean and median mortality rate for children 5-9 from \nHead Start susceptible causes equaled around 2.0 and 1.8 per 100,000, respectively.  So our \nestimates suggest that in the treatment counties near the cutoff, Head Start eliminates most of the \n\u201cexcess risk\u201d of death from these causes (that is, the difference in mortality rates from the \nnational average).  Put differently, a 50-100% increase in Head Start funding leads to a 33-75% \ndecline in mortality rates from relevant causes.  This impact seems plausible given that poverty is \na powerful risk factor for child health (Sing and Yu, 1996, Case, Lubotsky and Paxson, 2002). \nSome support for the idea that these mortality differences are due to Head Start rather \nthan other factors comes from the fact that we do not observe a similar discontinuity in mortality \nrates for children 5-9 from causes that should not be affected by Head Start \u2013 namely, injuries \n(second panel, Table 3).23  Although we might expect Head Start enrollment to affect \ncontemporaneous injury rate (see for example Currie and Hotz, 2004), we do not expect the \nprogram to affect accident rates for children ages 5-9", "Similarity Score": 0.7807148694992065}

The answer is not \nimmediately obvious because the official federal poverty rate was only invented in 1964, and so \nthe 1960 Census does not include a measure of persons living in poverty.

More worrisome is the possibility of non-random migration, \nwhich is not a real concern with our mortality results (given we measure outcomes at ages 5-9, \njust a few years after Head Start participation) although may be more of a problem with our \nschooling estimates.  But there are a few reasons to believe that our schooling estimates are not \nsimply artifacts of selective migration across counties. \nOne data point against the selective-migration hypothesis comes from the qualitative \nsimilarity in results between the 1990 Census, which assigns people to treatment and control \ncounties based on county of residence during adulthood, and the NELS, which assigns people to \ncounties based on where they live at age 13.  Migration across poor counties between ages 3-4 \nand age 13 appears to be modest at least according to the PSID, which provides small and \nunrepresentative samples \u201cclose\u201d to the OEO cutoff but at least lets us compare people in all 300 \npoorest counties with the next 300 poorest counties.  Of the respondents in the 300 poorest \ncounties at age 3, fully 86% were in one of these counties at age 13; of those in one of these \ncounties at age 13, 64% were in one at age 3.  Importantly, the results are similar for PSID \nrespondents in the next 300 poorest counties, and if anything slightly more low-education people \nare leaving the \u201ccontrol\u201d than \u201ctreatment\u201d counties", "Similarity Score": 0.7563261389732361}

A timing mismatch\nbetween the measurement of the mechanisms (sometimes only collected in later KLPS survey\nrounds) and intergenerational child mortality, for instance, make it difficult to establish tight\ncausal claims. Furthermore, given that the hypothesized mechanisms were not themselves\nrandomized in the original study design, mediation analysis may lead to biased inference\nalong the lines of the problem of \u201cbad control\u201d (Angrist and Pischke, 2009).\nThe point estimate on intergenerational infant (under-1) mortality is negative, and the\nproportional reduction in infant mortality is broadly in line with the reduction in under-\n5 mortality, but the infant mortality effect is not statistically significant. Several factors\nmay explain differences between the IMR and U5MR results. Previous studies suggest\n12that different pathways are more important in explaining intergenerational infant versus\nunder-5 mortality. Importantly, deworming led to improvements in adult socioeconomic\nand education outcomes, which are more commonly associated with U5MR (Omariba et\nal., 2007). We also find that deworming reduces the likelihood of miscarriage. Somewhat\nspeculatively, this would suggests that some additional children who may be less healthy are\nbeing born in the treated group; if these children are more susceptible to neonatal infections,\nthe leading cause of infant mortality globally (Liu et al., 2016), this would dampen the\ntreatment effect on infant mortality", "Similarity Score": 0.7562376856803894}

Similarly, households living outside the intervention clusters could visit a CHP in an intervention cluster.  Households in both intervention and control clusters could benefit from primary health care services provided by other actors, including private clinics, public primary health dispensaries and village health teams (a government community health worker program).

This narrower sample, however, is the price to pay for experimental variation in the\nchild health intervention. Furthermore, the limited sample size allowed for the gathering of\nmultiple rounds of rich survey data with low rates of sample attrition, which enables us to\nanalyze how adult life changes translate into child survival outcomes, including via multiple\nhypothesized mechanisms. Despite not being nationally-representative, the KLPS sample\nappears to be fairly typical of other SSA settings (see Appendix B). Furthermore, given the\nhigh prevalence of intestinal helminth infections in SSA and globally, the findings on the\ncausal intergenerational impacts of deworming are relevant in many other settings.\nThese findings suggest that deworming treatment has implications not only for reducing\n13infection rates and improving living standards among the current generation, but also po-\ntentially far-reaching implications on improving child survival (and possibly other outcomes)\nof the subsequent generation, along the lines of the \u201ctriple dividend\u201d proposed by Patton\net al.

One trial assessed the impact of Integrated Management of Childhood Illness (iMCI) program in Bangladesh19, finding no significant effect on under-5 mortality.  Lack of incentives for CHWs to deliver timely and appropriate services has been highlighted as a key challenge in traditional CHW programs", "Similarity Score": 0.7515872120857239}

Figure A.2 illustrates these different possibilities using the example of three children: child 1 was born before January 2011 and turned five years at time C (the same computation would hold if the child died under age 5 at time C). Hence the exposure to the risk of death under 5 for child 1 is represented by the (rounded) number of months between January 2011 and time C. Child 2 was instead born at time A, during the trial period, but died at time D. Hence, in this case the exposure to the risk of death under 5 is represented by the (rounded) number of months between time A and D. Finally, child 3 was also born during the trial, at time B, and was still alive at the time of the endline.

A CHP was assigned to each cluster in the intervention group. No CHP was assigned to the control clusters. The mean number of household per cluster was 237 at baseline.  The main objective of the trial was to assess the impact on under-five mortality of having a CHP working in the cluster. The evaluation design and implementation was independent of program implementation. All clusters were enumerated at baseline and a smaller household survey was administered to a randomly selected sample of households (on average 16 per cluster) to verify balance across assignment groups.

Within the next two years, the program is estimated to reach 4.3 million individuals in more than 4000 clusters. The impact 24!!of the CHP program was conditional on existing facility based professional health care as availability of referral services is a crucial component to the program. Thus the findings should encourage government and non-government organizations to continue improving their facility based care but also points to the importance of integrating the program into the existing health service provision strategy.

The CHPs market share for ACT drugs and ORS were 11.3% and 14.1% respectively. Under the assumption that every third dose of ACT treatment sold in the private market is fake and that authentic drugs are provided in the public sector (about 40% of the market share), children in the treatment group are 19% less likely to be treated with a fake ACT medicine.

We document that the children of\ndeworming recipients were more likely to survive to age 5.

Given the importance of early-life health\nfor later-life outcomes (Currie and Vogl, 2013), improved child survival (which implies im-\nproved child health) may have implications for intergenerational economic mobility.\nThird, we relate to a small but growing body of papers in economics using RCTs to study\ninterventions that reduce child mortality (Okeke, 2023; Haushofer et al., 2021).

However, not all gains have manifested equally across populations , and \nprogress for the health of children in low - and middle -income countries ha s stagnated, \nparticularly for preventable diseases.  \nWhile the causes of poor child health are complex, one important driver is the supply of \nhealth care. Poor child health outcomes can often be traced, in part, to the lack of high -\nquality, timely, and acce ssible health care. Resource constraints, weak organizational \ncapacity, and gaps in  care delivery c ontribute to poor quality of services (Berendes et al. \n2011)", "Similarity Score": 0.7397348284721375}

These effects are supported by changes in health knowledge, preventive behavior, case management of malaria and diarrhea, and home visits.  While a growing body of evidence has identified effective interventions that can be delivered by community health workers, a key consideration for the success and sustainability of such programs is how high-quality performance by community workers can be achieved and maintained. This study is the first impact evaluation of a community health delivery intervention based on an incentivized approach. Unlike previous studies that have primarily focused on the impact of specific interventions that could be delivered effectively in a community setting, our focus is on how to ensure that community health workers successfully implement a set of interventions proven to be effective if delivered and the impact that may have on child health.  In the CHP program, community health workers operated as micro-entrepreneurs earning an income on the sale of preventive and curative products. A concern with such a scheme is that it may encourage overuse of medications and inappropriate treatment at the expense of prevention and referrals. On the other hand, the provision of free services like health education and follow-up visits was viewed as strategy to build up a loyal customer base", "Similarity Score": 0.7339664101600647}

We used standardized data collection methods, and any potential recall lapses were expected to affect the intervention and control groups equally and thus lead to an attenuation bias that would lead us to estimate a lower bound on the impact of the CHP program on child mortality. We also used the end of trial sample survey to define baseline residence and thus the core sample for the analysis. Selective out-migration by assignment groups could have caused some confounding bias in our main estimates. However, measured in- and out-migration into the study clusters were similar across assignment groups (see table 3) and because baseline household characteristics of the sampled households that had lived in the same cluster for the whole study period were not statistically different between the intervention group and the control group (see table 2), we are confident that the results were not biased. Third, the possibility of contamination is plausible because the study clusters, within each zone, were geographically close. Analysis of behavioral data also suggested that some contamination occurred, most likely causing us to estimate a lower bound on the impact of the CHP program on child mortality.

Introduction \n \nThis paper provides new evidence on the effects of the Head Start program on schooling \nand health by drawing on a new source of variation in program funding.  We exploit a \ndiscontinuity in program funding across counties that resulted from how the Office of Economic \nOpportunity (OEO) launched the program during the spring of 1965 as part of the War on \nPoverty.  Head Start was established to provide preschool, health and other social services to \npoor children ages 3 or 4.  It represents one of the federal government\u2019s primary means for \naddressing the large disparities in cognitive and non-cognitive skills observed along race and \nclass lines well before children start school.1  Head Start currently serves over 800,000 children \neach year at a cost of around $7 billion (Haskins, 2004). \nEarly childhood may represent a particularly promising target for human capital \ninterventions given evidence that neurodevelopmental plasticity may decline with age, together \nwith the possibility of dynamic complementarities in learning (Duncan et al., 1998, Shonkoff and \nPhillips, 2000, Carniero and Heckman, 2003).  \u201cTwo generation\u201d programs like Head Start, \nwhich target parents as well as children, could also change the stream of human capital \ninvestments that parents make in their children over the life course", "Similarity Score": 0.7287190556526184}

The social internal rate of return (IRR) for deworming\ntreatment provides an estimate of the economic value of the benefits of deworming relative\nto the costs of providing treatment. School-based deworming is relatively inexpensive, and\nwe use recent cost estimates from school-based deworming in Kenya (see Appendix D for\ndetails). Valuing health gains is more challenging; there is a literature estimating disability-\nadjusted life years (DALYs) but few reliable estimates exist for Sub-Saharan African settings.\nWe take two approaches to identify a willingness to pay per DALY averted: the first uses the\nstated preference of Kenyan households\u2019 willingness to pay to avoid child health problems,\nand the second uses revealed preference measures (which are typically lower than stated\npreferences). We combine the estimated willingness to pay to avert a DALY figures with\ninformation on the time series of births in the sample, the estimated U5MR reduction (from\nTable 1), and the average value of life in terms of DALYs, to generate benefits over time.\nUsing stated and revealed preference approaches, the estimated willingness to pay per\nDALY averted is USD PPP 3611 and 67, respectively. Figure 3 presents the costs and implied\nintergenerational health benefits graphically, on a log scale.

The retail price was determined by branch managers with a target of keeping prices for preventive and curative products at least 20% lower than the prevailing local market prices. The CHPs in turn purchased these products directly from Living Goods or BRAC branches at wholesale prices between 30-50% below market prices and therefore earned an income on each product sold. Thus, the CHPs operated as micro-entrepreneurs with financial incentives to meet household demand.  The broad product mix had three potential benefits: (i) driving up total sales and income for the CHPs; (ii) enabling the NGOs to cross-subsidize prices (dropping prices on essential health products and increasing the margins on other products); (iii) motivating agents to be out visiting households regularly by including high-velocity items like soap and fortified foods in the product mix. The business training received by the CHPs stressed the importance of building up a customer-base by providing free services like health education, referrals, and newborn visits. In addition, the CHPs received small performance-based incentives to encourage registering 8!!of pregnant women and visits of newborns ($0.65 per registration/newborn visit).

Transfers conditi oned on pre - and post -natal care and routine health checks \nfor children can effectively increase household contacts with the health system and utilization of \nhealth services, including child immunization and growth monitoring.

Effects are largest when targeted at young ages , can appear fairly so on after transfers \nbegin, and persist several years after they are discontinued.

The current push towards cash transfer programs provides an \nopportunity for us to rigorously study these programs to understand their intended impacts and add \nto the knowledge base.

Also, p roviders are often overburdened with patient care and paperwork, which can \nlimit the qua ntity of care they give.  Yet at the same time, high absentee rates are common. \nIn India, for example, high absentee rates among health workers is compounded by \nsubstandard clinical practice (Chaudhury et al. 2006; Das et al. 2016). To address this, \npolicym akers have increasingly turned to pay -for-performance (P4P) \u2014incentive schemes \nthat directly reward providers for achieving certain standards of performance. \nGovernments in low- and middle -income countries  have increasingly been adopting \nperformance incenti ves in healthcare systems at multiple levels.  However, do these \nprograms really work? Only recently has there been rigorous evidence testing the impact of \nP4P on provider behaviors and, in turn, child health status.  \nThe goal of improving stagnating health outcomes has led to the growing interest in \nincentivizing health care workers. Yet several questions emerge around how best to do so. \nPolicymakers require information about how to design P4P schemes, in particular, who \nshould receive what kind of incentive , for which activities, and how often. More broadly, \ndesigning and implementing successful P4P schemes raise further questions about \nworkforce dynamics and structures, such as how incentives might change who chooses to \nbecome a healthcare worker, or how in centives might affect competition between workers", "Similarity Score": 0.7136333584785461}

Most of what we know about ef fective P4P design is a result of interpolation of \neffects across studies. The field is open for empirical work that can identify causal impacts \nof different design features. First, perhaps the most evident gap is on the effect of \nincentivization apart fro m income effects associated with bonus payments. A majority of \nthe effects we present are the combination of incentives and better financing. It is \nimportant for forthcoming studies to control for this income effect using appropriate \ncounterfactuals.

The data does not suggest that the program only had an impact on incentivized services, with evidence of increases in the promotion of healthy behavior and changed health beliefs. While there was a large increase in visits of newborns, for which the CHPs received a small incentive payment, there were also large increases in follow-up visits of children sick in malaria and diarrhea, for which no direct incentives were attached.  22!!Another concern is that charging for preventive and curative products, even when prices are subsidized, will disproportionately benefit the less-poor households. Table S1 however suggests similar impact across the household wealth distribution.  The case management of malaria was similar in the intervention and control group. Similar treatment pattern does not necessarily imply similar quality of treatment, however. The CHPs sell authentic ACT drugs.

There is \nopportunity for direct tests of these two design features that focus on provider innovat ion, \ntargeted provision, and cost -effectiveness.  \nIn the conceptual framework we noted how incentivizing outcomes allows providers to \ncreatively combine inputs using local knowledge.

For some programs such as JSY and Mamata  in Odisha, the program  guidelines clearly \nspecify the roles and responsibilities for managing the grievances. For instance, the JSY guidelines \nrequire states to set -up a grievance cell in each district, and allow some of the funds under the \nadministrative ex pense head to be used for meeting any expenses for the cells\u2019 functioning.

These are organized along the five key components of cash transfer programs which are \nimportant to the success of any cash transfer program, namely:  \n\u2022 Targeting and b eneficiary identification  \n\u2022 Benefit structure (frequency, size, timeliness and sufficiency of cash incentive)  \n\u2022 Payment system (type of payment system used, and issues of  financial inclusion)  \n\u2022 Conditions and their verification (choice of conditions, means of verifying compliance and \nenforcement), and  \n\u2022 Grievance redress system.  \n6.1 Targeting and Beneficiary Identification  \nAn important consideration in the design of a cash transfer program is related to the choice of program \nbeneficiaries. Specifically, program administrators need to decide whether the program benefits \nshould be targeted or universal . The ultimate choice depends on  the overall goals and objectives of \nthe pro gram, i.e., knowing who, in principle, should be reached by the program and why , as well as \nbudget constraints", "Similarity Score": 0.6890915036201477}

A \nconcern is that input incentives on a subset of tasks will concentrate effort towards those \ntasks to the detriment of the final outcome (multitasking  problem ). If tasks are substitutes \nin the production of the outcome, then incentives will tend to shift atte ntion to one task. If \ntasks are complements, then providers might be induced to perform even unincentivized \ntasks ; she engages more in the incentivized task, which raises the productivity of \nperforming the second task (by the definition of complementarity) , so she chooses to also \nengage more in the second task . One lesson from the multitasking literature is that when \nmultiple inputs contribute to a set of outcomes, outcome -based P4P allows the provider to \nuse local knowledge creatively to allocate effort ov er the different inputs to maximize \ncontracted outcomes.  For example, outreach activities and consultations may be best left \nunder the purview of providers.  14 \n The issue of multitasking also calls attention to potential unintended consequences of P4P. \nIf heal th care providers can influence outcomes by increasing quality and by manipulating \nrecords, then a P4P scheme may incentivize the latter if it is easier to misreport.

The current situation is very difficult to reconcile , it is no t  \n60 \n leakage or diversion. This is a huge blind spot for about a fifth of the beneficiaries which is not a small \nnumber.  This is the b iggest challenge, but it\u2019s gotten better over time. Even then, a fifth is a very large \nnumber .\u201d (Anonymous ).  \n \n The issue of unawareness of payment transfer gets compounded by the fact that beneficiaries often \ndon\u2019t receive any notification from the bank (via a n SMS text) informing them of the credit  (Singh \n2016, Muralidharan et al. 2017). A study on DBT in PDS found that while 65 percent of beneficiaries \nhad seeded their bank accounts with their mobile number, only 16 percent recollected receiving an \nSMS on the transfer in the previous month. Moreove r, there was considerable variation across months \non SMS receipts, and even when such messages were sent, the content of the message (i.e., absence \nof details about the purpose) and the language (i.e., English) made it uninformative for the beneficiary  \n(Muralidharan et al. 2017)", "Similarity Score": 0.634545624256134}

These  issues tend to b e parti cularly prevalent during the initial stages of a \nprogram\u2019s roll -out, and  are expected to resolve (or reduce) over time as the program\u2019s \nimplementation systems and processes g et streamlined. Importantly, the existing administrative set -\nup for most cash tran sfer programs is a major source of delay, which is likely to continue unless the \nsystem is changed. This is  to do with the mechanism through which the payment is triggered. As noted \npreviously, beneficiaries are required to provide a lot of paperwork at th e time of enrolment. In \naddition, for CCTs as well beneficiaries need provide paperwork confirming fulfilment of the \nconditions. All this paperwork needs to be verified and processed before the money can be  transferred \n\u2013 from FLW, the repor ts pass through her supervisors and from them to senior officials, and only after \nthe last official in the chain has verified the paperwork does the  payment get processed . Thus, any \ndelay in this chain can and does results in payment delays. Automating this process can help to reduce \nthe extent of these delays", "Similarity Score": 0.6329145431518555}
