## Detailed Findings

**Addressing Basic Needs:** The study on unmet healthcare needs in California highlights the importance of addressing basic needs (housing, food, safety) for women who use drugs to improve access to healthcare and social services.  The Whole Person Care Medicaid program is presented as a potential model for integrated service delivery.

**Digital Financial Services:** Research on digital financial services in Indonesia and other low- and middle-income economies shows that while DFS has increased access to formal financial services, significant challenges remain, particularly in reaching marginalized populations and ensuring equitable access for women.  Addressing digital literacy gaps and improving agent networks are crucial.  The study in Bangladesh demonstrates that while training programs can increase mobile banking usage, they may not always translate into equal economic benefits for women.

**Building Trust:** The study in Peru shows that building trust in financial institutions is a key factor in increasing savings among low-income populations.  A financial trust workshop significantly increased savings by improving trust, rather than financial literacy.

## Recommendations

Based on the reviewed research, the following recommendations are proposed to foster financial inclusion for women substance users in San Francisco's Mission District:

1. **Integrate Services:** Implement a holistic, integrated service delivery model similar to California's Whole Person Care program. This model should address not only substance use but also basic needs such as housing, food security, and healthcare.  Collaboration between healthcare providers, social workers, and financial institutions is crucial.

2. **Targeted Financial Literacy and Trust-Building Programs:** Develop and implement gender-specific financial literacy and trust-building programs tailored to the needs and experiences of women substance users.  These programs should focus on building trust in financial institutions, rather than solely on financial skills, as suggested by the Peruvian study.  The programs should also address potential barriers to access, such as lack of identification or digital literacy.

3. **Leverage Existing Infrastructure:** Explore opportunities to leverage existing government benefit programs and partnerships with financial institutions to expand access to financial services.  This could involve integrating financial services into existing healthcare or social service programs.

4. **Address Digital Divide:**  Assess the digital literacy levels of the target population and provide appropriate training and support to bridge the digital divide.  This is particularly important given the potential of digital financial services to improve access and reduce costs.

5. **Evaluate and Adapt:**  Implement a robust evaluation framework to monitor the effectiveness of the implemented policies and make necessary adjustments based on the data collected.  This will ensure that the programs are responsive to the evolving needs of the target population.

6. **Community Engagement:**  Engage with community organizations and leaders in the Mission District to ensure that the policies are culturally appropriate and meet the specific needs of the community.  This participatory approach will increase the likelihood of successful implementation and sustainability.


These recommendations aim to create a more inclusive and equitable financial system for women substance users in the Mission District, ultimately improving their health, well-being, and economic stability.
