Why, despite  actively  using bKash, do most female migrants  in the treatment  \ngroup not use it to send money  home?  One direct explanation  is that, in general,  female migrants  remit less home than \nmales. As Section  3.1 described,  female migrants  remitted  58% as much as men at baseline  ( Table 1 ).

What the authors \nfound was that these savings were typically placed in informal ROSCAs \n(rotating savings and credit associations) or under the mattress.

The data show that 50 percent of adults worldwide are \u201cbanked,\u201d that is, have an account at a formal financial institution, but also that account penetration varies across countries by level of economic development and across income groups within countries. For the half of all adults around the world who remain unbanked, the paper documents reported barriers to account use, such as cost, distance, and documentation requirements, which may shed light on potential market failures and provide guidance to policymakers in shaping financial inclusion policies.\nWell-functioning financial systems serve a vital purpose, offering \nsavings, payment, credit, and risk management products to people \nwith a range of needs", "Similarity Score": 0.7257940173149109}

More-inclusive financial systems\u2014those that allow broad access to appropriate financial services\u2014are likely to benefit poor \npeople and other disadvantaged groups. For instance, access to formal sav-\nings and credit mechanisms may facilitate investment in productive activi-\nties such as education or entrepreneurship. Lacking such access, individuals \nrely on their own limited, informal savings to invest in their education or 280 Brookings Papers on Economic Activity, spring 2013\nbecome entrepreneurs, and small enterprises on their limited earnings to \ntake advantage of promising growth opportunities. This can contribute to \npersistent income inequality and slower economic growth.1\nThis paper benchmarks financial inclusion and explores country- and \nindividual-level variation in how adults around the world use formal and informal financial products to manage their finances and plan for the future. We define financial inclusion as the use of formal financial services, and \nwe investigate how patterns of financial inclusion vary across countries at \ndifferent levels of income per capita, and within countries at different lev-\nels of relative income. Next, we examine the barriers to financial inclusion \nand document the relationship between subjective and objective barriers to \naccess. Finally, we discuss examples of public and private sector\u2013led initia-\ntives in this realm and how better data can inform policymakers in shaping \nfinancial inclusion policies", "Similarity Score": 0.7230834364891052}

These gaps are \nconsistent  with the facts that female migrants  earn less than men on average,  face cultural  barriers,  and are less likely to \nlive independently.

For example, the paper reported that a large \nfraction of the nonincluded chose not to have a bank account because they \nhad too little money to make it worthwhile. That seemed to Romer a plau-\nsibly rational response. Others said that they had a relative with a bank account, so that in effect they did have access to financial services even \nthough they were counted as excluded. Still others cited long distances to \nthe nearest bank branch as a reason for not having an account. Was that a \nmarket failure, or was it an equilibrium outcome?

World-wide, about 43 percent of account holders report having set aside money \nat a formal financial institution in the past year; the figure varies rela-\ntively little across country income groups. However, in many sub-Saharan \nAfrican countries, such as Liberia and Uganda, more than 65 percent of \naccount holders report saving formally. This suggests that in these coun-\ntries the ability to save in a secure location may motivate individuals to \nopen and maintain a formal account. In contrast, in many countries in \nCentral and Eastern Europe and Central Asia, adults do not primarily use \ntheir accounts to save: in this region fewer than one in six adults with a \nformal account report having saved or set aside money using a formal \naccount in the past year. In Georgia just 3 percent of account holders (and \n1 percent of all adults) report having saved using a formal account in the \npast year. However, adults in this region are especially likely to use their \naccounts to receive wages and government payments. This ability, rather \nthan the opportunity for saving, may thus be a key reason why these adults \nown formal accounts.\nMany adults, despite having a formal account, save solely using other \nmethods. These people, who might be classified as the \u201cunderbanked,\u201d \nconstitute 12 percent of account holders worldwide.

Second, we correct the\nstandard errors in these aggregate regressions for auto-correlation of an arbitrary form\nbetween observations in the wife\u2019s region of birth (as suggested in Bertrand, Du\ufb02o and\nMullainathan (2001).6\n6In practice, we use the stata \u201ccluster\u201d command, at the level of the wifes\u2019 region of birth\u201d. The\nstandard errors are thus larger than those reported in Du\ufb02o (2001), which was not implementing this\ncorrection\n10There is a testable restriction on the pattern of the coe\ufb03cients \u00b01l. Because children\naged 13 and older in 1974 did not bene\ufb01t from the program, the coe\ufb03cients \u00b01lshould\nbe 0 for l >12 and start increasing for lsmaller than some threshold (the oldest age at\nwhich an individual could have been exposed to the program and still bene\ufb01t from it).\nIn \ufb01gure 1, we show the coe\ufb03cients \u00b01lfor women (in solid lines) and men (in dotted\nlines). Each dot on a line is the coe\ufb03cient of the interaction between a dummy for being a\ngiven age in 1974 and the number of schools constructed per 1,000 children in the region\nof birth. For women and men, these coe\ufb03cients \ufb02uctuate around 0 until age 12 and\nstart increasing after age 12", "Similarity Score": 0.7014455199241638}

These findings, which I will summarize here, complement the \nauthors\u2019 results.\nThe existing literature allows one to identify four categories of obstacles \nto financial inclusion at the country level, which affect either the demand \nfor or the supply of financial services or both (see Rojas-Su\u00e1rez and  \nGonzales 2010 and Rojas-Su\u00e1rez and Amado forthcoming): socioeconomic \nconstraints, macroeconomic factors, characteristics of the operations of \nthe formal financial system, and institutional deficiencies. Here I will pres-\nent and discuss some simple correlations between these obstacles and one \nof the Global Findex indicators of financial inclusion, namely, the percent-\nage of the adult population with an account at a formal institution.\nWith regard to the first category, it is generally expected that coun-\ntries that score high on indicators of social development, such as access \nto high-quality health and education services, will also enjoy high levels \nof financial inclusion. As discussed by Stijn Claessens (2005), financial \nexclusion is often part of a broader social exclusion, which is related, \namong other factors, to differences in education, type of employment, and \ntraining", "Similarity Score": 0.6993365287780762}

These \naccounts are used for a wide range of purposes including receipt of wage \npayments, government transfers, and remittances from family members \nliving elsewhere.\nAt the country level, the Global Findex data show sharp disparities in \nthe use of financial services between high-income and developing coun-\ntries, confirming the findings of previous studies that show lower use of \nformal financial services in developing countries (see, for example, Beck, \nDemirg\u00fc\u00e7-Kunt, and Martinez Peria 2007 and Cull, Demirg\u00fc\u00e7-Kunt, and \nMorduch 2013).

It is described in\nmore details in Du\ufb02o (2001). Starting in 1973, the Indonesian government emphasized\nthe need for equity across provinces. Oil revenues were used to \ufb01nance centrally admin-\nistered development programs, the presidential instructions (INPRES). As a result of the\noil boom, real expenditures on regional development more than doubled between 1973\nand 1980, and the Sekolah Dasar INPRES program became very big. Between 1973-1974\nand 1978-1979, 61,807 primary schools were built across the country", "Similarity Score": 0.6915487051010132}

Additionally,\nthe structural design of digital services, including considerations such as trade-offs between government-implemented and\nprivately provided infrastructure, identification access, prioritizing interoperability2, and addressing regulatory frameworks and\ntechnology compatibility, is crucial for maximizing the potential of digital finance in advancing global financial inclusion efforts.3A review of twenty-eight randomized evaluations underscores the extensive and diverse impacts of digital financial services on\neconomic and welfare measures across contexts. Further, the integration of mobile banking with traditional systems showcases\nsubstantial advantages for microentrepreneurs, highlighting the multifaceted benefits that extend beyond addressing transaction\ncosts. The studies emphasize the importance of tailoring interventions to diverse populations, promoting financial literacy, and\nprioritizing consumer protection to unlock the full potential of digital financial services for inclusive economic growth and overall\nwell-being.\nTable\u00a0   1", "Similarity Score": 0.6911426186561584}

Individuals in higher-income countries are significantly more \nlikely to borrow from formal sources, such as banks or retail stores (col-\numn 1-6 of table 1; see also figure 7).

The pattern is reversed \nwith respect to the proportion of adults with informal credit: 37 percent of \nadults in Ukraine and 44 percent in Burundi, but only 15 percent in Fin-land, report having borrowed from family or friends in the past 12 months.\nThis propensity toward informal rather than formal lending is observed \nin both low- and middle-income countries.

Gender refers to socially constructed roles that vary based on time and place, and gender identity reflects one's internal sense of being a woman, man, or anywhere along the gender spectrum, including transgender, nonbinary, and genderqueer identities. In this article and in the fellowship track, we define 'women' as all individuals who identify as a woman, regardless of their sex (classification as male or female based on biological attributes). Intersectional perspectives recognize that women's experiences with drug use are not homogeneous. Rather, other intersecting identities, such as gender identity, sexual orientation, race/ethnicity, and socioeconomic class shape individual experiences of oppression or empowerment [5]. In particular, structural racism, homophobia, and transphobia enhance discrimination and treatment barriers for Black, Indigenous, and other racialized individuals and for transgender and genderqueer individuals compared to White cis-gender women who use drugs.\n\nWomen who use drugs interact with individuals, communities, and social systems that reproduce structural sexism.

Although rates of substance use generally are lower for women than for men [3][4][5], the physical and mental health consequences can be more profound for women [6]. Women who use alcohol and illicit drugs are at particular risk for hepatitis C and HIV infection, and are more likely to have psychiatric co-morbidity and multimorbidity [7]. In addition, substance use during pregnancy and while mothering has negative consequences for children, including risk for prematurity, impaired physical growth and development, physical and mental health problems, and development of substance use problems [8][9][10][11]. There is a need for services that effectively and comprehensively address the complex needs of women with substance use issues and their children. In addition to experiencing physical and mental health problems, these women often have personal histories of exposure to physical and sexual abuse and other relationship problems, negative or inadequate social support systems, inadequate income, unemployment, unstable housing, and involvement with the criminal justice system [12][13][14].

For example, gender-based power dynamics in drug-using communities may restrict women's autonomy to determine when, how, and why they use drugs. Such power imbalances are associated with greater adverse consequences in women compared to men including higher rates of injection drug use-associated infections, co-occurring mood and anxiety disorders, and experiences of intimate partner violence and sexual exploitation [8,9].\n\nStructural sexism is also apparent in the systems that affect pregnant and parenting people who use drugs. Pregnant individuals who use drugs face punitive consequences from legal and child welfare systems, hostility from the general public, and an addiction treatment system that is poorly suited to meet their needs. The child welfare system has traditionally viewed prenatal and parental substance use as synonymous with abuse or neglect, causing heightened shame, stigma, and fear of seeking treatment.
