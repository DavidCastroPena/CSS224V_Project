{"Source": "papers/FinancialInclusionEvidenceBrazil.pdf", "Content": ".edu1 Introduction\nThe presence of bank branches at fine geographical levels has long been considered a key\ndeterminant of financial inclusion and an important driver of economic growth. Bank branch\nproximity mitigates the transaction costs of mobilizing savings from many agents, which\ncan increase the capital available to entrepreneurs. Branch proximity also lowers the cost to\nbanks of screening and monitoring entrepreneurs, and of providing access to liquidity services.\nHowever, setting up bank branches is not only costly but also risky, as demand for deposits\nand loans can only be observed after the creation of the branch, which can lead to an under-\nprovision of financial services.\nFor this reason, policymakers across the world have sought to promote financial inclu-\nsion by implementing large-scale reforms to expand the physical networks of bank branches.1\nThe popularity of these financial inclusion policies raises multiple questions: do they suc-\nceed in promoting financial and economic development and, if so, how? And what are the\ndistributional consequences of such policies?\nIn this paper, we trace out the dynamic effects on both economic development and wage\ninequality of a government program that improved access to mainstream financial services.\nWe use the introduction of the \u201cBanks for All\u201d program ( \u201cBanco para Todos\u201d ) by the Brazil-\nian federal government in 2004, which explicitly targeted underbanked cities by introducing\nbranches of government-owned banks", "Similarity Score": 0.7118242383003235}

Our\npaper shows the importance of explicitly linking distance to the nearest bank to the cost and\navailability of credit as in the structural model of Ji, Teng, and Townsend (2023). We provide\ncausal estimates of how changes in distance can affect credit supply and savings in interest-\nbearing products, as well as their impact on employment, firm growth, and firm entry. We\nalso provide moments linking changes in the supply of credit and real outcomes, which relate\nto key parameters in macro-development models in which a reduced-form collateral constraint\naffects economic growth.

We use the data to benchmark financial inclusion\u2014the share of the population that uses formal financial services\u2014in countries around the world, and to investigate the significant country- and individual-level variation in how adults use formal and informal financial systems to manage their day-to-day finances and plan for the future. The data show that 50 percent of adults worldwide are \u201cbanked,\u201d that is, have an account at a formal financial institution, but also that account penetration varies across countries by level of economic development and across income groups within countries. For the half of all adults around the world who remain unbanked, the paper documents reported barriers to account use, such as cost, distance, and documentation requirements, which may shed light on potential market failures and provide guidance to policymakers in shaping financial inclusion policies.\nWell-functioning financial systems serve a vital purpose, offering \nsavings, payment, credit, and risk management products to people \nwith a range of needs", "Similarity Score": 0.705622673034668}

To\ndo so, we separately interact our main Treated\u00d7Post variable with the distance to the nearest\npublic bank and with the distance to the nearest private bank. Intuitively, if our results hinge\non access to subsidized credit, the effect of the reform should be stronger for cities that were\nfar from a government-controlled bank than for those that were far from a private bank.\nWe report these results in Table 5. In panel A, we show that our results are much stronger\nin cities with no bank presence prior to the reform. Cities without a local private bank\nbefore the reform experience a larger increase in the number of firms (10.4%, column 1), in\nemployment (13.9%, column 2), and in average wages (7%, column 5). In panel B, we show\nthat, conditional on not having a local private bank pre-reform, the real effects of financial\ninclusion increase with the distance to the nearest bank.\nBoth sets of results are consistent with the reform promoting economic development by\nreducing the distance between borrowers and lenders, which lowers the monitoring and screen-\ning costs of financial intermediaries. This idea is also consistent with the result that small\nfirms (fewer than 20 employees) benefit more from the reduction in distance than large firms\n(column 3 vs", "Similarity Score": 0.7056151628494263}

If bank \nregulation today in some developing countries is comparably weak, that argued against pushing for greater inclusion.

The Global Findex data can shed light on the \nlevels and patterns of use of different financial services both globally and \namong different groups, such as poor people, youth, and women.

The role of policy is to broaden finan-\ncial inclusion to reach those who are excluded because of market failures.\nI.A. Indicators\nThe first set of indicators focuses on the ownership and use of an account \nat a formal financial institution. For most people a formal account serves \nas an entry point into the formal financial sector. Having a formal account \nfacilitates the transfer of wages, remittances, and government payments. It \ncan also encourage formal saving and open access to credit.

Then why did banks not serve these markets prior to\nthe reform? Two reasons can explain this pattern.\nFirst, on the revenue side, monopolistic competition and downward-sloping demand curves\nimply that banks can maximize their markups and hence their profits by restricting quantities,\nwhich will restrict bank expansion.45The limit on bank network expansion will be amplified\nwhen the uncertainty about the profitability of possible markets is high (e.g., Hellmann,\nMurdock, and Stiglitz, 1997), which is likely the case for many smaller cities in a developing\ncountry like Brazil.46\nSecond, on the cost side, the existence of fixed costs to set up a branch and the need to\nminimize the distance across branches to minimize costs implies that banks do not decide on\nbranch locations in an unconstrained way, but instead will extend their network in a capillary\nway and up to a certain limit, particularly in a country as geographically large as Brazil.\nTherefore, cities where banks would be profitable if historical branch networks were different\nmay remain unbanked", "Similarity Score": 0.6969051361083984}

An estimate\nfrom the World Bank posits that approximately 1.7 billion people, primarily residing in\nunderdeveloped countries, are devoid of basic banking facilities, such as checking accounts or\nstandardsavingsproducts( Demirguc-Kuntetal. ,2018). Thissituationstarklycontrastswith\ndeveloped economies like the United States, where a mere 4.5% of households are \u201cunbanked\u201d\n(FDIC,2021). This deprivation from finance could impede economic development by curbing\naggregate investment and employment and distorting capital allocation among firms and\npotential entrepreneurs ( Hsieh and Klenow ,2009;Buera et al. ,2011;Bazzi et al. ,2021;\nFonseca and Matray ,2022).\nMany developing countries have implemented place-based policies to stimulate bank ex-\npansion in lagging regions, believing that these policies have the potential to ignite economic\ngrowth and alleviate poverty through better access to financial services. Previous literature,\nutilizing both Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs) and natural experiments, tends to high-\nlight substantial benefits to industrial growth and household well-being in areas that have\nseen an influx of banking services ( Burgess and Pande ,2005;Bruhn and Love ,2014;Young,\n2017;Cramer,2021;Fonseca and Matray ,2022;Barboni et al. ,2021)", "Similarity Score": 0.6935778856277466}

The record on \fnancial inclusion, however, has not kept apace. Large amounts of credit\ndo not always correspond to broad use of \fnancial services, as credit is often concentrated among\nthe largest \frms. Moreover, \frms in developing countries evidently continue to face barriers in\naccessing \fnancial services. For instance, 95 percent of \frms in advanced economies have access to\na bank loan or line of credit as compared with 58 percent in developing economies, and 20 percent\nin low-income countries (Figure I). Collateral requirements for loans, which impose borrowing\nconstraints on \frms, are also 2-3 times as high in developing countries as compared to advanced\neconomies. Similarly, interest rate spreads (the di\u000berence between lending and deposit rates) tend\nto be much higher than in advanced economies", "Similarity Score": 0.6887568831443787}

In par-\nticular, a potential entrant can enter a market with low \u2126/Nonly if it also enters a market\nwith relatively high \u2126/N. The policy thus has redistributive effects across districts, allowing\nbanks to enter districts with strong institutional environments only if they also enter markets\nwith less favorable environments. Using the model, we can simulate which districts would\nhave experienced entry absent the policy given changes in \u2126/NandF\u03c3. We can then com-\npare the counterfactual outcomes with the observed outcomes to determine the redistributive\neffects of the policy. We can also consider alternative policies such as direct entry subsidies\ntargeted to districts with poor financial access. These counterfactuals will be informative\nabout bank policy in India and other developing countries with weaker financial institutions\nand regional inequality.\n6.12 Extensions to the Model\nAn important extension to the model is to specify a labor market and preferences for workers.\nAdding these features can allow us to speak to the empirical results on structural transfor-\nmation from Section 5.

More generally,\nmost of the literature on developing countries has used randomized controlled trial and shocks to specific banks\n7This level of analysis coupled with data on the universe of bank branch networks in Brazil\nallows us to provide the first causal estimate of the role of distance to financial services, a\nkey parameter in macro-development models that analyze the role of banks, and to highlight\nthat financial inclusion is not a dichotomous concept but should instead be thought of as\ncontinuous.\nTaken together, our results have several policy implications. First, financial inclusion poli-\ncies can generate large effects on economic development, even while banks operate profitable\nbranches. Second, these policies can have large distributive effects, in particular as they in-\nteract with constraints on human capital accumulation. Third, the initial distance to existing\nbank branches matters for the expected gains in terms of economic development. Therefore,\nfinancial inclusion policies can reap larger benefits at lower costs by carefully taking into\naccount the initial network of bank branches, which is important given the large number of\npolicies around the world attempting to foster economic development by promoting financial\ninclusion.\nThis paper also contributes to the empirical literature using natural experiments to show\nhow financial frictions, broadly defined, affect economic development", "Similarity Score": 0.6877906918525696}

Private Banks\nThis figure plots the yearly coefficients and 95% confidence intervals of the difference-in-differences estimator in equation (1) of\nthe 2004 bank reform. Dependent variables are dummies that equal one if the city has at least a branch of any bank, a public\nbank, or a private bank, respectively. Standard errors are clustered at the matching-pair level.\nTwo facts are noteworthy. First, the probability of having a branch from a private bank\nin treated and control cities evolve in close parallel prior to the reform. This result indicates\nthat private banks in treated and control cities evolved in the same way during the large\ncredit boom that Brazil experienced prior to the reform, and remain on similar trends even\nafter the reform.\n21Second, the expansion of public banks only modestly crowds out private banks, resulting\nin a large increase in overall financial development for treated cities. The probability of\nhaving a public bank branch or any bank branch increases sharply after 2004, in line with the\naggregate pattern reported in Figure 1, and it continues to increase progressively throughout\nthe period with no mean reversion post reform.\n4.2 Increased deposits and credit\nWe then study how this higher presence of bank branches affects deposits and credit supply.\nIn order to measure financial development net of any mechanical wealth effects, we compute\ntotal credit and total deposits scaled by city GDP", "Similarity Score": 0.6819204688072205}

In the next section, we analyze macroeconomic\nimplications of \fnancial inclusion and identify the role that country characteristics play in the\nprocess.\n5 Evaluation of Policy Options\nAs mentioned above, \fnancial inclusion is re\rected by three parameters in our model. The credit\nparticipation cost,  , directly measures the di\u000eculty of obtaining credit. A decrease in its value\ntherefore re\rects greater \fnancial access. The parameter \u0015in the borrowing constraint coincides\ndirectly with the maximum leverage ratio, an increase in which re\rects lower collateral requirements.\nFinally, a decrease in the cost of state veri\fcation, \u001f, indicates an increase in the \\e\u000eciency\" of\n\fnancial intermediation. It should be noted that the percent of \frms with credit in our model is\n22endogenous and is a\u000bected by all the three parameters.\nBecause \fnancial inclusion is multidimensional, it is di\u000ecult to identify precisely the meaning\nof these three parameters from an empirical standpoint. However, one can \fnd evidence of policies\nthat address one dimension or the other. For example, Assuncao, Mityakov and Townsend (2012)\nand Alem and Townsend (2013) \fnd that the distance to a bank branch matters for credit access,\nwhich suggests that policies that promote branch openings in rural, unbanked locations could\nhelp reduce the credit participation cost,", "Similarity Score": 0.6805285811424255}

Financial frictions can directly impact labor demand if there is a mis-\nmatch between payments to labor and the generation of cash-flows or if labor has a fixed-cost\ncomponent due to hiring and firing costs (Schoefer, 2021; Benmelech, Bergman, and Seru,\n2021). Since skilled workers require higher wages and are arguably more expensive to recruit\nand train, financial frictions disproportionately constrain the demand for skilled labor and,\nwhen lessened by the reform, lead to an increase in the demand for skilled labor relative to\nunskilled labor.\nAlternatively, if capital and skilled labor are relative complements, looser financial con-\nstraints can increase capital investment and, consequently, increase the marginal productivity\nof skilled workers relative to unskilled workers, also leading to an increase in the relative\ndemand for skilled workers (Fonseca and Doornik, 2021). A testable implication of either ver-\nsion of the skilled labor demand hypothesis is that, as the relative demand for skilled workers\n35rises, both the relative price and the relative quantity of skilled workers should rise, leading\nto an increase in the skill premium andin the share of skilled workers in treated cities.\nThird, labor demand might go up uniformly across the skill distribution, but the supply\nof unskilled workers could be more elastic than the supply of skilled workers", "Similarity Score": 0.6799162030220032}

Farmers in villages with lower agricultural suitability strongly respond to the reform\nand transition away from agriculture", "Similarity Score": 0.6780357956886292}

This reallocation could be driven by two channels. First, bank expansion could\ndirectly impact agricultural investments and activities, and this effect may be more evident\nin remote and isolated areas. Second, there could be a general equilibrium effect of bank\nexpansion.

Therefore,\nwhen production succeeds the gross output should be at least higher than the capital input. On the other hand,\nif the entrepreneur defaults, the bank will monitor output and seize the face value of the loan anyway. Thus, the\nentrepreneur has no incentive to default.\n10The threshold between low and high leverage ratio is derived by considering whether the value of interest-bearing\ncollateral plus the recovered working capital is su\u000ecient to repay the face value of the loan.

However, because of the \nobstacles, the predicted ratio is only 43 percent.\nThe most important conclusions to be drawn from the table are as \nfollows. First, the degree of social development matters greatly. The low level of social development in developing countries on average, and to \na lesser extent in emerging markets, hampers financial inclusion through \nboth demand and supply factors. Second, only in the developed economies \ndoes the high level of institutional quality at least partly offset the adverse \neffect of bank concentration on financial inclusion (the sum of the implied \ncontributions for the bank concentration variable alone and for the bank concentration \u00d7 rule of law interaction is positive). In contrast, in emerging \nmarkets and other developing countries on average, low institutional qual-ity cannot counteract the financial exclusion effects of bank concentration. \nThird, relative to the other factors, inflation volatility and banking ineffi-\nciencies play smaller roles as obstacles to financial inclusion.\nMy discussion here provides just a taste of the potential uses of the \nGlobal Findex database and is intended as a complement to the authors\u2019 \nanalysis and their ongoing research.

The results presented in Figure 6lend support to our\nmain hypothesis that industrial growth creates more job opportunities in non-agricultural\nsectors and thus facilitates structural transformation. However, it is important to consider\nan alternative hypothesis that bank expansion may also increase industrial labor supply.\nAssuming non-homothetic preferences, such as a subsistence consumption requirement for\nagricultural goods, workers in places with lower agricultural productivity may self-select into\nagriculture because they are poorer ( Lagakos and Waugh ,2013). Bank expansion would\nhave a stronger impact in less productive places by relaxing this subsistence requirement and\nincreasing industrial labor supply.\nTo provide additional evidence supporting our hypothesis regarding the role of labor\ndemand, we examine the heterogeneous effects of the reform. If the labor demand hypothesis\nis valid, we would expect to see a stronger effect of the reform in villages that can better\nleverage the industrial expansion.
