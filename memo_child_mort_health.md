**To**: County Officials
**From**: Public Health Policy Analyst
**Date**: October 26, 2023
**Re**: Strategies to Reduce Child Mortality from a Public Health Perspective

This memo addresses your request for information on creating a policy to reduce child mortality in your Mississippi county from a public health perspective. It summarizes relevant findings from academic papers and provides potential policy considerations.

**Summary of Research Findings**

| Title of Paper | Location | Publication Date | Methodology | Key Findings on Child Mortality Impact |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Intergenerational Child Mortality Impacts of Deworming: Experimental Evidence from Two Decades of the Kenya Life Panel Survey | Busia County, Kenya | March 31, 2023 | Linear probability model, logistic and probit regression | Under-5 mortality rate fell by 22% for children of treatment group individuals. |
| Does Head Start Improve Children’s Life Chances? Evidence from a Regression Discontinuity Design | 300 poorest counties in the U.S. | October, 2005 | Regression Discontinuity (RD) design | Large negative discontinuity in mortality rates for children ages 5-9 from preventable causes. |
| Mortality and Morbidity in the 21st Century | United States | Spring, 2017 | Descriptive analysis of mortality and morbidity data | Focuses on midlife mortality; does not directly address child mortality. |
| EFFECT OF A MICRO ENTREPRENEUR-BASED COMMUNITY HEALTH DELIVERY PROGRAM ON UNDER-FIVE MORTALITY IN UGANDA: A CLUSTER-RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL | Uganda | September, 2016 | Cluster-randomized controlled trial | U5MR reduced by 27%, IMR by 33%, NMR by 27%. |
| Revising Infant Mortality Rates for the Early 20th Century United States | United States | March 2017 | Analysis of census microdata and infant death counts | Revised estimates suggest lower Black infant mortality rate than previously reported. |
| Reducing Child Mortality in the Last Mile: Experimental Evidence on Community H... | Uganda |  | Randomized controlled trial | Child mortality dropped by 27 percent in CHP villages relative to the comparison group. |


**Detailed Findings from Individual Papers**

* **Intergenerational Child Mortality Impacts of Deworming:**  This study found a dose-response relationship between deworming and child mortality reduction, with improvements seen through parent health, education, living standards, fertility patterns, and health care utilization.
* **Does Head Start Improve Children’s Life Chances?:** This study suggests Head Start's impact is significant and long-lasting, particularly in reducing child mortality and improving educational attainment. The study used a regression discontinuity design, comparing counties near a funding cutoff.
* **Mortality and Morbidity in the 21st Century:** This paper focuses on increasing midlife mortality among white non-Hispanics in the US, attributing it to "deaths of despair." It does not directly address child mortality.
* **EFFECT OF A MICRO ENTREPRENEUR-BASED COMMUNITY HEALTH DELIVERY PROGRAM ON UNDER-FIVE MORTALITY IN UGANDA:** This study highlights the effectiveness of an incentivized community health worker program in reducing U5MR, IMR, and NMR. The program utilized micro-entrepreneurs selling health products and providing services.
* **Revising Infant Mortality Rates for the Early 20th Century United States:** This paper focuses on correcting historical data on infant mortality, finding lower Black infant mortality rates than previously reported.  The study highlights the importance of accurate data for policy analysis.
* **Reducing Child Mortality in the Last Mile:** This study demonstrated a significant reduction in child, infant, and neonatal mortality through a community health program in Uganda. The program incentivized community health workers through sales of health products and small incentives for visits.


**Policy Recommendations**

Based on the research, potential policy interventions to consider include:

* **Community Health Worker Programs:** Implement or strengthen community health worker programs, potentially incorporating incentives for performance, similar to the successful models in Uganda.
* **Early Childhood Interventions:** Invest in early childhood development programs like Head Start, which have shown positive impacts on child mortality and other outcomes.
* **Addressing "Deaths of Despair":** While not directly related to child mortality, addressing the root causes of "deaths of despair" (substance abuse, suicide) in the adult population can indirectly benefit children through improved family stability and well-being.
* **Data Collection and Analysis:** Ensure accurate and comprehensive data collection on child mortality and its contributing factors to inform targeted interventions.

Further research tailored to the specific context of your county is recommended to identify the most effective strategies.  This includes analyzing local data on child mortality causes, existing health services, and socioeconomic factors.  Collaboration with state and national public health agencies can provide additional resources and expertise.
