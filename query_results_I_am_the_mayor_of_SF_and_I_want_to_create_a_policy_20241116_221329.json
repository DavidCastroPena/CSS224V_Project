It just requires som e tweaks.  And it just requires frankly \nunderstanding what women want.

Figure 1also reports\nthe share of municipalities without any bank branch (the solid blue line), and shows that\nthe expansion of public banks resulted in a drop in the share of cities without any bank\nbranches.14\nThe program succeeded in reaching unbanked cities and underbanked populations. Ac-\ncording to an evaluation of the program by the federal government, public banks opened\n7.8 million accounts and banked 1.46 million low-income, previously unbanked individuals\nbetween 2004\u20132007 (Minist\u00b4 erio da Fazenda, 2007).15In Section 4, we formally show that\ncities without public bank branches prior to 2004 saw a sharp increase in credit and deposits\nfollowing the introduction of the program.\nBanking correspondents. In order to reach unbanked households, the program also relied\non correspondent banking outlets. These arrangements consist of banks hiring commercial\nentities\u2014typically lottery retailers, post offices, pharmacies, and other retailers\u2014to serve\nas distribution outlets for financial services. Since 2003, financial services offered by corre-\nspondents include the opening of accounts, deposits and withdrawals, payments, and loan\n14. Between 2004 and 2014 (the end of our sample period), 1,262 new bank branches were open in cities\neligible to the reform.\n15.

They don't have \ntime, and we've heard this over and over again in the last 35 years of doing research on \nwomen 's lives, that they don't have time to go stand in line at a bank branch to deposit \ntheir money.  Or they're so far away from a bank branch that the money it would take to \ntake a bus to that bank ranch was actually more than they were depositing.  So digit al \nfinancial services has an incredible potential to serve women's needs for that \nconvenience.  It also helps address security.  So women, you know, as Leora was talking \nabout, carrying money around, a digital savings account can help address that security  \nissue.  \n  And confidentiality, which is so critical.  A woman wants to know that the \nmoney that she earns is safe; that she can control her own assets and not have to be \nsharing and telling her husband, her relatives, other friends in the village what she is \ndoing with her money.  And so setting up savings accounts in a digital environment I think \nare the critical product to help with financial inclusion.  And one of the things that John \nhad said at the beginning, you know, the models look different.  So wh en you think about \ndigital savings in the context of an agent banking model, one of my favorite expressions \nnow that just came about in the last two weeks, our team was in Malawi and they said \nthat savings and agent banking go together like sima and relish .  Now, sima and relish is \nprobably the equivalent of peanut butter and jelly",
