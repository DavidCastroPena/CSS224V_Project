The purpose of this project was to develop, pilot and evaluate an evidence-based curriculum that addressed knowledge gaps and behavioral risk factors related to determinants of infant mortality in low-income households in Mississippi.", "Similarity Score": 0.8117092847824097, "URL": "http://diversityhealthcare.imedpub.com/evaluation-of-a-health-education-intervention-toimprove-knowledge-skills-behavioral-intentionsand-resources-associated-with-preven.pdf"}

However, according to the American Dietetic Association, adopting appropriate eating habits should allow children to achieve optimal physical and cognitive development, attain a healthy weight, enjoy food, and reduce the risk of chronic disease. An increased number of childhood overweight conditions has driven dietitians to address children's over consumption of foods and beverages that are lacking in proper nutrients [2], and to highlight the need to improve their nutritional intake [3][4][5] because children's food choices very often result in poor nutrient intakes [6,7]. Data from the Bogalusa Heart Study and the USDA showed an overall decline in the total amount of milk, vegetables, soups, breads, grains, and eggs consumed from 1973 to 1994 [7][8][9][10][11]. Researchers have also reported that approximately 68% to 75% of children exceed the current dietary recommendations for intake of total or saturated fats [12]. American schools that participate in the National School Lunch Program and School Breakfast Program have been given guidelines to encourage an improved quality of nutrient consumption among school children.
