This does not mean that nothing can be done. Controlling opioids is an obvious priority, as is try -\ning to counter the longer-term negative effects of a poor labor market on marriage and child rearing, perhaps through a better safety net for mothers with children that would make them less dependent on unstable partnerships in an increasingly difficult labor market.\nPRELIMINARIES  First, a few words about methods. Our earlier paper (Case \nand Deaton 2015) simply reported a set of facts\u2014increases in mortality and morbidity\u2014that were both surprising and disturbing. The causes of death underlying the mortality increases were documented, which identified the immediate causes but did little to explore underlying factors. We are still far from a smoking gun or a fully developed model, though we make a start in section III. Instead, our method here is to explore and expand the facts in a range of dimensions, by race and ethnicity, by education, by sex, by trends over time, and by comparisons between the United States and other rich countries",

Higher percentages of households in CHP\nvillages reported that they treated water before using it (which helps prevent diarrhea), that their children slept under insecticide-\ntreated bed nets the previous night (which helps prevent malaria), and that they treated their children\u2019s diarrhea with zinc or oral\nrehydration salts.\nThe CHP program increased households\u2019 access to services that CHPs were not paid to perform along with those that were incentivized.\nRelative to the comparison group, households in CHP villages were more likely to receive services that CHPs were incentivized to\nperform. For example, during the first week after giving birth, households in CHP villages were 8.1 percentage points (71 percent)\nmore likely to receive a follow-up visit from any health care worker, an increase from 11.4 percent in the comparison group. Yet,\nhouseholds also experienced an increase in services that were not directly incentivized. For example, households in CHP villages\nwere 6.1 percentage points (73 percent) more likely to receive follow-up home visits after a child fell sick with malaria, an increase\nfrom 8.4 percent in the comparison group.\nIncentivized CHWs can drastically reduce child mortality.  The CHP program studied here provides CHWs with incentives to increase\naccess to low-cost, high-impact health products and basic newborn and child health services. Results show that it led households\nto increase health-promoting behaviors and usage of life-saving products",

The CHPs were selected through a competitive process among female community members aged 18 to 45 who applied for the position in each village and who possessed basic writing and math skills. Eligible candidates received 2 weeks of health and business training, covering preventing, diagnosing and treating childhood illness, recognizing danger signs for referral, healthy pregnancy and newborn care, and nutrition. At the end of the training, a skills test was administered to determine who would become an active CHP. Selected CHPs \n7!!also attended a one-day training each month to review and refresh key health and business topics. The CHPs tasks were to conduct home visits, educate households on essential health behaviors, provide basic medical advice, referring the more severe cases to the closest health center, and to sell preventive and curative health products. The CHPs were also instructed to visit newborns within the first 48 hours of life and to encourage pregnant women to deliver in a facility or with professional assistance. The product line they had at disposal included prevention goods (e.g. insecticide treated bednets, water purification tablets, and vitamins), curative treatments (e.g., oral rehydration salts, zinc, and ACTs), as well as other health-related commodities (e.g. diapers, detergent, and hand soap) and durables with health benefits (e.g",
