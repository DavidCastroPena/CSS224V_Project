Even if there may be a desire to work and to save money, government regulations may produce a disincentive to both. For women who are recovering from substance dependence and other related adverse life events (such as HIV infection, poor health, intimate partner violence, and mental health concerns), it may be difficult to see the value of engaging in economic empowerment activities with so little economic independence. This paper attempts to explore these issues to enhance our knowledge of effective interventions that support women on disability living in low-income communities and high-risk environments to gain access to the workforce. The Women's Economic Empowerment pilot (WEE) described here was initiated to better understand the acceptability and feasibility of implementing a structural intervention to promote women's economic empowerment in an urban context. Grounded in social cognitive [19,20] and asset theories [21], the intervention targeted behavior change by building women's self-efficacy in sexual health decision making and condom negotiation and use, while also promoting economic stability through training in financial literacy and the accumulation of economic assets", "Similarity Score": 0.7860842943191528, "URL": "https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/20/8/5511/pdf?version=1681453333"}

Gender refers to socially constructed roles that vary based on time and place, and gender identity reflects one's internal sense of being a woman, man, or anywhere along the gender spectrum, including transgender, nonbinary, and genderqueer identities. In this article and in the fellowship track, we define 'women' as all individuals who identify as a woman, regardless of their sex (classification as male or female based on biological attributes). Intersectional perspectives recognize that women's experiences with drug use are not homogeneous. Rather, other intersecting identities, such as gender identity, sexual orientation, race/ethnicity, and socioeconomic class shape individual experiences of oppression or empowerment [5]. In particular, structural racism, homophobia, and transphobia enhance discrimination and treatment barriers for Black, Indigenous, and other racialized individuals and for transgender and genderqueer individuals compared to White cis-gender women who use drugs.\n\nWomen who use drugs interact with individuals, communities, and social systems that reproduce structural sexism.

Generally, studies indicate that these women have myriad co-occurring problems in the areas of mental health, domestic violence, and medical care, as well as legal issues.

Interventions that provide gender-specific services and coordination across multiple service domains to address the co-occurring problems these women experience may be most effective.\n\nTwo recent studies examined the effectiveness of case management (CM) at addressing the multiple problems experienced by substance-abusing women on welfare: CASAWORKS for Families (CWF) (Morgenstern et al. 2003b) and CASASARD (Morgenstern et al. 2001b). These CM interventions, designed specifically for TANF women, provided linkages to needed wraparound services in many areas, including housing assistance, mental health treatment, medical treatment, child care, and transportation.

Women who use alcohol and illicit drugs are at particular risk for hepatitis C and HIV infection, and are more likely to have psychiatric co-morbidity and multimorbidity [7]. In addition, substance use during pregnancy and while mothering has negative consequences for children, including risk for prematurity, impaired physical growth and development, physical and mental health problems, and development of substance use problems [8][9][10][11]. There is a need for services that effectively and comprehensively address the complex needs of women with substance use issues and their children.

Pregnant individuals who use drugs face punitive consequences from legal and child welfare systems, hostility from the general public, and an addiction treatment system that is poorly suited to meet their needs.
