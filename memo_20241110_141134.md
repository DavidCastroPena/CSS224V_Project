**Table of Research Papers**

| Paper Title | Main Location | Date Written | Key Variables | Policy Recommendations | Methodology Limitations | Findings on Bank Branches | Methodology Differences | Alignment with Theories |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Financial Inclusion, Economic Development, and Inequality: Evidence from Brazil | Brazil | May, 2022 | Bank branches, credit, deposits, employment, wages, skill premium, education | Carefully consider initial network of bank branches | Lack of data on banking correspondents, inability to conduct cost-benefit analysis | Larger impact of bank branches on economic development than other studies | Use of administrative panel data, focus on profitable commercial banks | Aligns with prevailing theories, highlights importance of worker heterogeneity |
| Bank Expansion, Firm Dynamics, and Structural Transformation: Evidence from India’s Policy Experiment | India | November, 2023 | Firm-level sales, assets, wages, employment, productivity, district-level capital, sales, employment | Relax migration constraints, increase bank presence in underdeveloped regions | Exogenous urban labor supply, no endogenous innovation | Focus on impact of bank expansion on firm dynamics and labor allocation | Difference-in-Discontinuity design, controlling for district fixed-effects | Aligns with some studies on competition, contradicts others |
| ADVANCING FINANCIAL INCLUSION IN INDIA BEYOND THE JAN-DHAN YOJANA | India | January, 2015 |  | Broaden range of financial services, leverage indigenous institutions |  |  |  |  |
| Distinguishing Constraints on Financial Inclusion and Their Impact on GDP and Inequality | Developing Countries (Uganda, Kenya, Mozambique, Malaysia, Philippines, Egypt) | January, 2015 | Credit participation cost, collateral constraints, intermediation efficiency | Tailor policy advice based on country-specific characteristics | Simplified overlapping generations framework, no explicit firm-worker relationship |  | Incorporates multiple financial frictions | Impact of financial inclusion depends on specific constraint |

**Summary of Specific Paper Findings:**

* **Financial Inclusion, Economic Development, and Inequality: Evidence from Brazil:** This paper highlights the significant impact of bank branch expansion on economic development in Brazil. The study emphasizes the importance of considering the initial network of bank branches when implementing financial inclusion policies.
* **Bank Expansion, Firm Dynamics, and Structural Transformation: Evidence from India’s Policy Experiment:** This paper examines the impact of bank expansion on firm dynamics and labor allocation in India. The study suggests that relaxing migration constraints could be more effective than simply increasing bank presence in underdeveloped regions.
* **ADVANCING FINANCIAL INCLUSION IN INDIA BEYOND THE JAN-DHAN YOJANA:** This paper advocates for a broader approach to financial inclusion in India, going beyond just providing bank accounts and credit to the poor. The study emphasizes the need for innovative savings instruments, insurance products, and leveraging indigenous institutions.
* **Distinguishing Constraints on Financial Inclusion and Their Impact on GDP and Inequality:** This paper analyzes the impact of different financial constraints on economic growth and inequality in developing countries. The study highlights the importance of tailoring policy interventions to address specific constraints within each country.

* **Leverage existing infrastructure:**  Explore ways to leverage existing infrastructure, such as the postal network and community organizations, to expand access to financial services.
* **Promote financial innovation:**  Support the development and adoption of innovative financial products and services that meet the needs of underserved populations.
